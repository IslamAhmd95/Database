## why should we move from spreadsheets to database ?

- Scale
	   1. Spreadsheets are great for small datasets but struggle with large volumes of data.
	2. Databases can handle millions (or billions) of records efficiently and are designed to grow with your needs.
- Frequency "تكرار"
	   1. Spreadsheets are static and require manual updates.
	2. Databases allow frequent and automated data updates, supporting real-time data changes and processing.
- Speed
	   1. Spreadsheets become slow when handling complex calculations or large datasets.
	2. Databases use optimized query engines and indexing to retrieve and process data quickly, even with high demand.

## SQL "Structured Query Language"
A language via which you can create, read,update, delete data from database .

--- 

## SELECT statement
 ---
 
## LIMIT

--- 

## WHERE

```sql

SELECT "title", "author" FROM "bookslist" WHERE "format" != 'hardcover' AND ("year" = 2022 OR "year" = 2021) LIMIT 5;

SELECT * FROM "bookslist" WHERE NOT "format" = 'hardcover' LIMIT 10;

```

--- 

## NULL

```sql

SELECT "title" FROM "bookslist" WHERE "translator" IS NULL;
SELECT "title" FROM "bookslist" WHERE "translator" IS NOT NULL;

```

## Wildcard Characters in SQL (`LIKE`)

### 1. `%` (Percentage Sign)  
- Represents **zero or more characters** in a string including spaces .  
- Commonly used for flexible matching in patterns.  
- Remember that `like` is case-insensitive but `equal sign` is case-sensitive.

**Examples:**  
- `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'A%';`  
  Matches names starting with "A" (e.g., "Alice", "Andrew").  

- `SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%phone';`  
  Matches names ending with "phone" (e.g., "Smartphone", "iPhone").  
  
- `SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE 'S%phone';` Matches names starting with "S" and ending with "phone" (e.g., "Smartphone", "Sapphirephone").
  
### 2. `_` (Underscore) 
- Represents **exactly one character** in a string which also can be a space.  

**Examples:**  
- `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE '_ike';`  
  Matches names like "Mike" or "Nike" (any 4-character word ending with "ike").  

- `SELECT * FROM codes WHERE code LIKE 'A_1';`  
  Matches codes like "AB1" or "AC1" (starts with "A", ends with "1", and has one character in between).  
  
- `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'M_ke';` Matches names with "M" as the first letter, "k" as the third, and "e" as the fourth (e.g., "Mike").
  
### Combination Example:
 - `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE 'A_%_z';`
   Matches usernames starting with "A", ending with "z", and containing at least two characters in between (e.g., "A1Xz", "A_bcz").

## Range conditions

### 1. Comparison Operators
Used to filter data based on a range of values.

- **`<`**: Less than a specified value.  
  **Example:**  
  `SELECT * FROM products WHERE price < 50;`  
  Retrieves products priced less than 50.

- **`>`**: Greater than a specified value.  
  **Example:**  
  `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30;`  
  Retrieves employees older than 30.

- **`<=`**: Less than or equal to a specified value.  
  **Example:**  
  `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE quantity <= 10;`  
  Retrieves orders with quantities of 10 or fewer.

- **`>=`**: Greater than or equal to a specified value.  
  **Example:**  
  `SELECT * FROM sales WHERE revenue >= 1000;`  
  Retrieves sales with revenue of 1000 or more.

### 2. `BETWEEN ... AND ...`
Used to filter values within an inclusive range (including both boundaries).

**Example:**  
- `SELECT * FROM products WHERE price BETWEEN 20 AND 50;`  
  Retrieves products priced between 20 and 50, including 20 and 50.

- **Dates Example:**  
  `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';`  
  Retrieves orders placed within the year 2024.

### 3. `IN` Operator  
Filters values that match a specific set of values.

**Example:**  
- `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IN ('HR', 'Finance', 'IT');`  
  Retrieves employees working in HR, Finance, or IT.

### 4. `NOT BETWEEN`
Filters values **outside** a specific range.

**Example:**  
- `SELECT * FROM products WHERE price NOT BETWEEN 20 AND 50;`  
  Retrieves products priced outside the 20-50 range.

### 5. Custom Ranges Using Logic  
Combine multiple conditions for more flexible ranges.

**Example:**  
- `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30 AND age < 50;`  
  Retrieves employees aged between 31 and 49.

- `SELECT * FROM products WHERE price < 10 OR price > 100;`  
  Retrieves products priced below 10 or above 100.

## `ORDER BY` in SQL

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set of a query by one or more columns.

### 1. Ascending Order (`ASC`)  

- Default sorting order: smallest to largest for numbers, and alphabetically for text.  
**Example:**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary ASC;
```
Sorts employees by salary in ascending order.

### 2. Descending Order (`DESC`)

- Reverses the order: largest to smallest for numbers, and reverse alphabetical for text.

**Example:**  
```sql  
  SELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price DESC;
```
Sorts products by price in descending order.

### 3. Sorting by Multiple Columns

- You can specify multiple columns to sort by.
- The order is determined sequentially based on the listed columns.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC;
```
- First sorts employees alphabetically by department.
- Within each department, employees are sorted by salary in descending order.

### 4. Ordering by Expressions

You can use expressions or calculated values in `ORDER BY`.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT *, price * quantity AS total_cost  FROM sales  ORDER BY total_cost DESC;
%% the second * is a multiplication sign %%
```
- Sorts sales by the calculated total cost in descending order.

## Aggregate Functions in SQL

Aggregate functions are used to perform calculations on multiple rows of data to return a single result.
We have also `Scalar functions` like `ROUND()` which operate on a single value and return a single value.

### 1. `COUNT()`  
- Returns the number of rows that match a specified condition.

**Example:**  
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;
```
Counts the total number of employees.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department) FROM employees;
```
Counts the number of unique departments.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(translator) FROM bookslist;
```
Counts number of rows where translator is not null.
### 2. `SUM()`  
- Calculates the total sum of a numeric column.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;
```
Calculates the total salary of all employees.

### 3. `AVG()`
- Returns the average value of a numeric column.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT ROUND(AVG(salary), 2) AS average_rating FROM employees;
%% `ROUND()` is applied to format the result to 2 decimal places. %%
```
Calculates the average salary of all employees.

### 4. `MIN()`
- Returns the smallest value in a column.
  
**Example**:
```sql
SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees;
```
Finds the minimum salary.

### 5. `MAX()`
- Returns the largest value in a column.

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;
```
Finds the maximum salary.

### 6. `GROUP_CONCAT()` (MySQL) / `STRING_AGG()` (PostgreSQL)
- Concatenates values from multiple rows into a single string.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(name) FROM employees;
```
Concatenates all employee names into a single string.

### 7. Using Aggregate Functions with `GROUP BY`
- Aggregate functions can be used with `GROUP BY` to perform calculations on each group of rows.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department
```
Finds the average salary for each department.

### 8. Filtering Aggregate Results with `HAVING`
The `HAVING` clause filters results after aggregate functions are applied.

**Example**:
```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING AVG(salary) > 5000
```
Retrieves departments where the average salary is greater than 50,000.

## HAVING vs WHERE

### Having:
- Filters aggregated data **after** `GROUP BY`.
- Works with grouped results or aggregated values.
  
```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
```

### WHERE:
- Filters rows **before** any grouping or aggregation.
- Works with individual rows.
  
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30 GROUP BY department;
```

### Both Combined:

```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE age > 30 GROUP By department HAVING AVG(salary) > 5000
```

## Ideas

### Query to Get the Titles with the Minimum and Maximum Lengths:
```sql
SELECT 
    title AS min_title, CHAR_LENGTH(title) AS min_length
FROM bookslist
ORDER BY CHAR_LENGTH(title) ASC
LIMIT 1;


SELECT 
    title AS max_title, CHAR_LENGTH(title) AS max_length
FROM bookslist
ORDER BY CHAR_LENGTH(title) DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
