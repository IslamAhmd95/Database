### Subqueries

```sql
SELECT title 
FROM books 
WHERE publisher_id = (SELECT id FROM publishers WHERE name = "Islam");

SELECT title 
FROM books 
WHERE publisher_id IN (SELECT id FROM publishers WHERE name = "Islam");
%% 
- **Use Query 1 (`=`)** if you are certain the subquery will return exactly **one row**.
    - It is slightly more efficient because the SQL engine doesn not need to evaluate multiple potential matches.
- **Use Query 2 (`IN`)** if there is any chance the subquery could return **multiple rows**.
    - It is safer and more flexible for dynamic data.
%%



SELECT * 
FROM authors 
WHERE id = (
    SELECT author_id 
    FROM authored 
    WHERE book_id = (
        SELECT id 
        FROM books 
        WHERE title = "The Art of Wars"
    )
);
%% retrieve the author "one single author" of a specific book %%

SELECT * 
FROM authors 
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT author_id 
    FROM authored 
    WHERE book_id = (
        SELECT id 
        FROM books 
        WHERE title = "The Art of Wars"
    )
);
%% retrieve the author/authors of a specific book %%

%% Improved query %%
SELECT a.*
FROM authors a
JOIN authored au ON a.id = au.author_id
JOIN books b ON au.book_id = b.id
WHERE b.title = "The Art of Wars";
%% this inner join works for both scenarios, whether it is one author or multiple authors and the performance in joins is more better than subqueries %%
%% a.* specifies that only the columns from the `authors` table will be included in the result set. %%
```

### Joins

#### Inner Join
```sql
SELECT * FROM "sea_lions" JOIN "migrations" ON "migrations"."id" = "sea_lions"."id";
%% select all the matching records from both tables %%
```

#### Outer Join
##### Left Outer Join
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM "sea_lions" 
LEFT JOIN "migrations" 
ON "migrations"."id" = "sea_lions"."id";

%% Select all rows from the **left table** (`sea_lions`), including the matching rows from the **right table** (`migrations`). For rows in the left table that do not have a match in the right table, the columns from the right table will be `NULL`. %%
```

##### Right Outer Join
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM "sea_lions" 
RIGHT JOIN "migrations" 
ON "migrations"."id" = "sea_lions"."id";

%% Select all rows from the **right table** (`migrations`), including the matching rows from the **left table** (`sea_lions`). For rows in the right table that do not have a match in the left table, the columns from the left table will be `NULL`. %%
```

##### Full Outer Join
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM "sea_lions" 
FULL OUTER JOIN "migrations" 
ON "migrations"."id" = "sea_lions"."id";

%% Select all rows from both the **left table** (`sea_lions`) and the **right table** (`migrations`). If there are no matching rows between the tables, the unmatched columns will contain `NULL`. %

%% Ensure your database system supports **FULL OUTER JOIN**. Some systems (like MySQL) do not support it directly, but it can be emulated using a `UNION` of `LEFT JOIN` and `RIGHT JOIN`. %%
```

#### Natural Join
A **NATURAL JOIN** is a type of SQL join that automatically joins tables based on **columns with the same name** and compatible data types in both tables. Unlike `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, or other types, where you must explicitly specify the columns to join on using the `ON` clause, a **NATURAL JOIN** automatically matches columns with the same names between the tables, it performs an **INNER JOIN** by default. It joins the tables on columns with the same names and returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM "sea_lions" 
NATURAL JOIN "migrations";
```

- **NATURAL JOIN** eliminates the need to specify a condition, but it assumes the join is made based on columns with the same name.
- Only **columns with the same name** will be matched. If there are multiple columns with the same name, the join will happen based on all those columns.
- **Duplicate columns** (those with the same name in both tables) will appear only once in the result.
- You have **no control** over which columns are used to join, and if there are columns with the same name but different meanings, it could lead to unexpected results.
- It might lead to ambiguous results if the tables have more than one column with the same name and it is not clear which columns should be used for joining.
- Be cautious when using **NATURAL JOIN**, especially with large or complex tables, because it might join on unexpected columns if the tables contain multiple columns with the same name.
- It is often better to use explicit joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, etc.) when you want more control over which columns are joined.

### Sets
a **set** generally refers to a **collection of values** that are returned by a query. This can include rows, columns, or specific data points based on the query conditions.

**SET operations** like `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT` are used to combine, compare, or subtract result sets from different queries. These operations allow you to perform logical set operations on the results of multiple `SELECT` statements.

#### `UNION`
- Combines the result sets of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result set, eliminating duplicate rows.
- It only returns distinct rows.
- Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

- Example:
```sql
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR'
UNION
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT';
%% This will return a list of employee names from both the `HR` and `IT` departments, without duplicates. %%
```

- The columns in both `SELECT` statements must have the same number and compatible data types.
  
#### `INTERSECT`
- Returns only the rows that appear in both result sets (i.e., the **common rows**).
- It effectively finds the intersection of two sets.
- Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

- Example:
```sql
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR'
INTERSECT
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT';
%% This will return only the names of employees who are in **both** the `HR` and `IT` departments. If no one belongs to both, the result will be empty. %%
```


#### `EXCEPT` (or `MINUS` in some databases like Oracle)
- Returns rows from the first result set that **do not exist** in the second result set.
- It effectively subtracts one set from another.
- Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
EXCEPT
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table2;
```

- Example:
```sql
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'HR'
EXCEPT
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT';
%% This will return the names of employees who are in the `HR` department but **not** in the `IT` department. %%
```


####  Key Points about Set Operations:
- **All of these operations work with result sets** from `SELECT` queries.
- **`UNION`** removes duplicates (unless you use `UNION ALL`, which keeps duplicates).
- **Column consistency**: The columns selected by each query in the set operation must match in number and data type for the operation to work correctly.
- These operations are **not specific to any one table**; they operate on the results of queries from potentially different tables or conditions.
- `UNION ALL` is another set operation that works the same like `UNION` but does not remove duplicates
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;
```

- `INTERSECT ALL` is similar to `INTERSECT`, but it returns **all** the common rows, including duplicates and also not supported in all databases.
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
INTERSECT ALL
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2;
```

- While not technically set operations, SQL allows using **comparison operators** (like `=` or `IN`) to perform set-based comparisons.
```sql
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE column1 IN (SELECT column1 FROM table2);
```

### Groups

```sql
SELECT "book_id", ROUND(AVG("rating"), 2) AS "Average rating" 
FROM "ratings" 
GROUP BY "book_id" 
HAVING AVG("rating") > 3.0;
%%  use AVG("rating") instead of the alias with HAVING %%

SELECT "book_id", ROUND(AVG("rating"), 2) AS "Average rating" 
FROM "ratings" 
GROUP BY "book_id" 
HAVING AVG("rating") > 3.0 
ORDER BY "book_id" DESC;
%%  use AVG("rating") instead of the alias with HAVING %%

SELECT "book_id", COUNT("rating") AS "Count rating" 
FROM "ratings" 
WHERE "rating" > 2.0 
GROUP BY "book_id"
HAVING COUNT("rating") > 3
ORDER BY "book_id" DESC;


**NOTE**
- In some SQL environments (like MySQL), it is typical to use backticks (`) instead of double quotes for identifiers like table and column names (though this depends on your DBMS). If you are working in an environment that supports double quotes for identifiers (such as PostgreSQL), then your query is perfectly fine.
```
