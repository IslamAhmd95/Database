### Inserting

```sql
-- create table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "collections" (
	"id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
	"title" TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
	"accession_number" TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
	"acquired" NUMERIC
);

-- insert a record
INSERT INTO "collections" ("title", "accession_number", "acquired") VALUES ('', '', '');

-- insert multiple records at once
INSERT INTO "collections" ("title", "accession_number", "acquired") 
VALUES 
('', '', ''),
('', '', ''),
('', '', '');
```

-- -

### Importing

```sql
-- create table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "collections" (
	"id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
	"title" TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
	"accession_number" TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
	"acquired" NUMERIC
);

.import --csv --skip 1 file.csv collections
-- this is a sqlite command to import a csv file into our db, skipping the first line, with the file name of **file.csv** into table **collections**

-- If I want to import data from csv file which has (title, accession_number, acquired) but doesn't have an id, this will produce an error when importing this file directly to the **collections** table . so, i will import the file data to the **temp** table with only 3 fields (title, accession_number, acquired) then moving these data to table **collections** and finally delete this **temp** table .
-- the query to move the data from **temp** to **collections** 
INSERT INTO "collections" ("title", "accession_number", "acquired")
SELECT "title", "accession_number", "acquired" FROM "temp";
-- finally delete this temp table
DROP TABLE temp;
```

-- -

### Deleting

```sql
-- delete all records from the table
DELETE * FROM "collections";

-- delete records based on some condition
DELETE * FROM "collections" WHERE "id" = 3;
DELETE * FROM "collections" WHERE "acquired" IS NULL;
DELETE * FROM "collections" WHERE "acquired" < '1900-01-01'; --YYYY-MM-DD
```

### Foreign Key Constraints

Foreign key constraints are not enforced by default in SQLite. Enable them with the following command:
```sql
PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
```

#### Constraints:
- **CASCADE**: Deletes or updates the foreign key rows automatically.
- **SET NULL**: Sets the foreign key column to `NULL` when the referenced row is deleted.
- **RESTRICT**: Prevents the action if the foreign key constraint would be violated.
- **NO ACTION**: Similar to `RESTRICT`, but enforcement depends on the database engine.

### Updating

```sql
-- update the `post_id` in the `users_posts` table based on certain condition
UPDATE users_posts
SET post_id = (
    SELECT id FROM posts WHERE title = 'some_title'
)
WHERE user_id = (
    SELECT id FROM users WHERE name = 'some_name'
);
-- alternative using join in postgreSQL
UPDATE users_posts u_p
SET post_id = p.id
FROM posts p
JOIN users u 
ON u.name = 'some_name'
WHERE u_p.user_id = u.id AND p.title = 'some_title';
-- alternative using join in SQlite
UPDATE users_posts
SET post_id = (
    SELECT p.id
    FROM posts p
    JOIN users u ON u.name = 'some_name'
    WHERE users_posts.user_id = u.id AND p.title = 'some_title'
)
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM posts p
    JOIN users u ON u.name = 'some_name'
    WHERE users_posts.user_id = u.id AND p.title = 'some_title'
);
-- alternative using join in MYSQl
UPDATE users_posts u_p
JOIN users u ON u_p.user_id = u.id
JOIN posts p ON p.title = 'some_title'
SET u_p.post_id = p.id
WHERE u.name = 'some_name';


UPDATE "votes" SET "title" = trim("title");
-- The `trim()` function in SQLite trims any whitespace characters (`spaces`, `tabs`, `newlines`) from both ends of the string.

UPDATE "votes" SET "title" = upper("title");
-- upper() uppercases the entire string, islam ahmed -> ISLAM AHMED

UPDATE "votes" SET "title" = 'some_text' WHERE "title" LIKE '_b%';
-- Updates the `"title"` column to `'some_text'` where the current value matches the pattern `_b%`.
```

### Triggers
A **trigger** is a set of SQL statements that automatically execute when a specific event occurs in a database table. Triggers are often used for maintaining data integrity, enforcing rules, or logging changes.

#### Key Components of Triggers

1. **Triggering Event**:
    - Defines when the trigger should fire: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`.
2. **Trigger Timing**:
    - Specifies when the trigger runs:
        - `BEFORE`: Executes before the operation.
        - `AFTER`: Executes after the operation.
3. **Trigger Scope**:
    - Applies to a specific table or view.

#### Syntax
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_name
[BEFORE | AFTER] [INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE]
ON table_name
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- SQL statements to execute
END;
```

#### Examples
1- Logging Changes to a Table

Imagine a table `employees` where we want to log changes into a `log` table.
```sql
-- Create the log table
CREATE TABLE log (
    log_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    action TEXT,
    old_data TEXT,
    new_data TEXT,
    change_time DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Create the trigger
CREATE TRIGGER after_employee_update
AFTER UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO log (action, old_data, new_data)
    VALUES ('UPDATE', old.name || ', ' || old.position, new.name || ', ' || new.position);
END;

-- Explanation:
-- The trigger fires **AFTER** an `UPDATE` on the `employees` table.
-- It logs the `old` and `new` values of `name` and `position` into the `log` table.
```

2- Auto-Updating a Timestamp

For a table `orders`, update a `last_modified` column whenever a row is updated.
```sql
-- Create the orders table
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name TEXT,
    total_amount REAL,
    last_modified DATETIME
);

-- Create the trigger
CREATE TRIGGER update_last_modified
BEFORE UPDATE ON orders
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    UPDATE orders SET last_modified = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE order_id = old.order_id;
END;

-- Explanation:
-- The trigger fires **BEFORE** an `UPDATE` on the `orders` table.
-- It updates the `last_modified` column to the current timestamp.
```

3- Restricting Deletions

Prevent deletion of rows from a `users` table where the user has an active subscription.
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER prevent_user_deletion
BEFORE DELETE ON users
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    SELECT 
    CASE
        WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM subscriptions WHERE user_id = old.id AND status = 'active') THEN
            RAISE(ABORT, 'Cannot delete user with active subscription')
    END;
END;

-- Explanation:
-- The trigger fires **BEFORE** a `DELETE` on the `users` table.
-- If the user has an active subscription, the `DELETE` operation is aborted.
```

4- Automatically Insert Related Data

When a new order is added to `orders`, automatically insert a row into the `shipping` table.
```sql
-- Create the shipping table
CREATE TABLE shipping (
    shipping_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    order_id INTEGER,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'Pending',
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
);

-- Create the trigger
CREATE TRIGGER add_shipping_record
AFTER INSERT ON orders
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO shipping (order_id) VALUES (new.order_id);
END;

-- Explanation: 
-- The trigger fires **AFTER** an `INSERT` on the `orders` table.
-- A new row is added to the `shipping` table with the `order_id`.
```


#### Where they are saved ?

Triggers in SQL are created and saved **inside the database**. They are stored as part of the schema of the table to which they are associated. Once created, triggers exist within the database and are automatically executed when the specified event (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`) occurs on the associated table.

- In **SQLite**, you can query the `sqlite_master` table to see the triggers:
```sql
SELECT * FROM sqlite_master WHERE type = 'trigger';
```

- In **PostgreSQL**, you can query the `pg_trigger` system catalog:
```sql
SELECT tgname FROM pg_trigger;
```

- In **MySQL**, you can use the `SHOW TRIGGERS` command:
```sql
SHOW TRIGGERS;
```


#### Dropping Triggers

- SQLite
```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_name;
``` 

- MYSQL
```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_name;
```

- PostgreSQL
```sql
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_name ON table_name;
```


#### Notes:

- **Performance**: Triggers can impact performance, especially if they contain complex logic or are frequently triggered.
- **Debugging**: Debugging triggers can be tricky since they execute automatically. Use logging to track their activity.
- **Portability**: Trigger syntax varies slightly between databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).

### Soft Delete

```sql
ALTER TABLE "users" ADD COLUMN "deleted" INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

UPDATE "users" SET "deleted" = 1 WHERE "title" = 'some_title';

SELECT * FROM "users" WHERE "deleted" != 1;
```


---

### What Does `RAISE(ABORT, '...')` Do?
The `RAISE(ABORT, '...')` statement in SQLite raises an error and **aborts the transaction**.

- **Effect**: If the condition specified in the `CASE` statement is met, the trigger raises an error with the provided message (`'Cannot delete user with active subscription'`).
- **Result**: The `DELETE` operation is stopped, and no changes are made to the database.
  
For example, if you try to delete a user with an active subscription, youâ€™ll see an error like:
`Error: Cannot delete user with active subscription`

---

### What Are `OLD` and `NEW`?
In SQL triggers, `OLD` and `NEW` are **contextual row variables** that refer to the values of the row being affected by the triggering event:

- **`OLD`**:
    - Refers to the row's data **before** the operation.
    - Available for `UPDATE` and `DELETE` triggers.
    - Example: In a `DELETE` trigger, `OLD.id` refers to the `id` of the row being deleted.
- **`NEW`**:
    - Refers to the row's data **after** the operation.
    - Available for `INSERT` and `UPDATE` triggers.
    - Example: In an `INSERT` trigger, `NEW.name` refers to the `name` being inserted.
