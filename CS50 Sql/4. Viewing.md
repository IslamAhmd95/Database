#### View
The Virtual table defined by a query

starting with this schema of the `authors`, `books` tables with their junction table `authored`
![[Pasted image 20250101083902.png]]


ended up with this simple table for every author and his book
![[Pasted image 20250101083817.png]]

#### Why would we do that ?

- Simplify our data
- Aggregate our data, try to sum up some values and store that in a single table
- Partition our data, divide it into logical pieces
- Secure our data, hide some data we don't want somebody to see

---

### Simplifying 

```sql
SELECT title, name
FROM books b
JOIN authored au ON au.book_id = b.id
JOIN authors a ON au.author_id = a.id;
-- Retrieve a list of **all books' titles and their respective authors' names**

-- Syntax to create a view and save it as a part of my schema
CREATE VIEW name AS
SELECT ... ;

CREATE VIEW "longlist" AS
SELECT title, name
FROM books b
JOIN authored au ON au.book_id = b.id
JOIN authors a ON au.author_id = a.id;
-- **View Creation**:
    -- This creates a **view** named `longlist`.
    -- A view is a virtual table based on the result of the `SELECT` query. It doesn't store data physically but acts as a stored query.
-- **Columns in the View**:
    -- `title`: The titles of books from the `books` table.
    -- `name`: The names of authors from the `authors` table.
-- **Purpose**:
    -- The view retrieves **all book titles** and their **respective authors' names**, including many-to-many relationships between books and authors.
-- **Fetching Data from the View**:
	SELECT * FROM "longlist";
	SELECT * FROM "longlist" ORDER BY "title" DESC;
	SELECT "name" FROM "longlist" WHERE "title" = "some_title";
	-- Querying the view just like querying a regular table.
```

### Aggregating

```sql
CREATE VIEW "average_books_ratings" AS
SELECT 
    "books"."id" AS "book_id", 
    "books"."title", 
    ROUND(AVG("ratings"."ratings"), 2) AS "AverageRating", 
    "books"."year"
FROM "ratings"
JOIN "books" 
ON "ratings"."book_id" = "books"."id"
WHERE "ratings"."ratings" > 1
GROUP BY "books"."id", "books"."title", "books"."year"
ORDER BY "AverageRating" DESC;
-- Create a view named "average_books_ratings" to store the average ratings for books.
-- The view includes the book ID ("book_id"), title, average rating (rounded to 2 decimal places), and the year.
-- Views in databases are typically virtual tables, meaning they don't occupy physical space but are generated dynamically when queried.
-- In some database systems like PostgreSQL and SQLite, all non-aggregated columns (e.g., "book_id", "title", "year") must be included in the GROUP BY clause.
-- Aggregated fields, such as "AverageRating", do not need to be included in the GROUP BY clause because they are computed after grouping.
-- the view will always reflect the most up-to-date data in the underlying tables (`ratings` and `books`) because it is a **virtual table**. Whenever you query the view, it executes the underlying `SELECT` statement dynamically, fetching the latest data from the tables.
```

### Temporary Views
Create a temporary view exists only for the duration of my connection to db

```sql
-- Syntax
CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW name AS
SELECT ...;

-- A view or a temporary view can be created from another view.
-- you **cannot create a permanent view from a temporary view**, but you can create another **temporary view** from an existing temporary view.
-- Here, we create a temporary view that calculates the average ratings grouped by year.
CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW "average_ratings_by_year" AS
SELECT 
    "year", 
    ROUND(AVG("AverageRating"), 2) AS "AverageRatingYearly" 
FROM "average_books_ratings"
GROUP BY "year";

-- Querying the temporary view to display the average ratings grouped by year.
SELECT * FROM "average_ratings_by_year";
-- Since the view references `average_books_ratings`, any changes in the `average_books_ratings` view or the underlying tables (`ratings` and `books`) will automatically reflect in `average_ratings_by_year`.
```

-- -

### Common Table Expression "CTE"
A view exists for a duration of a single query

```sql
-- drop a view
DROP VIEW "average_books_ratings";

-- Syntax to create a CTE
WITH name AS (
    SELECT ...  -- CTE query
)
SELECT ... ;  -- Main query using the CTE data


WITH "average_books_ratings" AS (
    SELECT 
        "books"."id" AS "book_id", 
        "books"."title", 
        ROUND(AVG("ratings"."ratings"), 2) AS "AverageRating", 
        "books"."year"
    FROM "ratings"
    JOIN "books" 
    ON "ratings"."book_id" = "books"."id"
    WHERE "ratings"."ratings" > 1
    GROUP BY "books"."id", "books"."title", "books"."year"
    ORDER BY "AverageRating" DESC
)
SELECT "title", "year", "AverageRating" 
FROM "average_books_ratings";
-- **CTE Definition**: The part inside `WITH` defines the **Common Table Expression**. It selects the `book_id`, `title`, `AverageRating`, and `year` from the `ratings` and `books` tables, with proper grouping and averaging.
-- **Main Query**: The second part, `SELECT "title", "year", "AverageRating" FROM "average_books_ratings";`, retrieves the columns from the CTE.
```

-- -

### logical partitioning

```sql
CREATE VIEW "2022" AS
SELECT "title", "id" FROM "books" WHERE "year" = 2022;


CREATE VIEW "2021" AS
SELECT "title", "id" FROM "books" WHERE "year" = 2021;

SELECT * FROM "2022";
SELECT * FROM "2021";
```

---

### Securing

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "rides" (
	"id" INTEGER,
	"origin" TEXT NOT NULL,
	"destination" TEXT NOT NULL,
	"rider" TEXT NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY("id")
);

-- I don't want to share the riders with somebody else, but tell them that we have a field for riders here

SELECT "origin", "destination", 'Anonymous' AS "rider" FROM "rides";
-- This will replace all rider's names with 'Anonymous' word

-- create a view for it
CREATE VIEW "analysis" AS 
SELECT "origin", "destination", 'Anonymous' AS "rider" FROM "rides";
```

---

### Triggers with Views

```sql
CREATE VIEW "current_collections" AS
SELECT "id", "title", "accession_number" FROM "collections" WHERE "deleted" = 0;

-- Syntax to run trigger over a view
CREATE TRIGGER name
INSTEAD OF [INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE] ON view
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN condition   -- optional
BEGIN
	... ;
END


-- If I try to delete records from the "current_collections" view directly, it will produce an error 
-- because views are not inherently updatable, and DELETE operations cannot be performed on them 
-- unless explicitly supported by the database or implemented through triggers.

-- To handle this, I can create an INSTEAD OF DELETE trigger on the "current_collections" view.
-- This trigger will intercept DELETE operations on the view and perform an equivalent soft delete 
-- operation on the underlying "collections" table by updating its "deleted" column.
CREATE TRIGGER "soft_delete_on_collections"
INSTEAD OF DELETE ON "current_collections"
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Mark the record as deleted in the "collections" table
    UPDATE "collections" 
    SET "deleted" = 1 
    WHERE "id" = OLD."id";  -- we use ; here 
END;  -- we use ; here

-- Explanation:
-- - "OLD" represents the row that the DELETE operation tried to remove from the "current_collections" view.
-- - The trigger updates the "deleted" column in the "collections" table for the corresponding row instead.
-- - Now, when I run a DELETE operation on the "current_collections" view, the operation will succeed, 
--   and the corresponding record in the "collections" table will be soft deleted (marked as "deleted = 1").



CREATE TRIGGER "insert_when_exists"
INSTEAD OF INSERT ON "current_collections"
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN NEW."accession_number" IN (
    SELECT "accession_number" FROM "collections"
)
BEGIN
    -- Reactivate a previously soft-deleted record by setting "deleted" to 0
    UPDATE "collections" 
    SET "deleted" = 0 
    WHERE "accession_number" = NEW."accession_number";  -- always use ; here
END;
-- **Trigger Purpose**:
    -- The trigger is created to handle `INSERT` operations on the view `current_collections`.
    -- If the `accession_number` of the record being inserted (`NEW.accession_number`) already exists in the `collections` table, the trigger will reactivate (soft-undelete) that record instead of inserting a new one.
-- **`INSTEAD OF` Trigger**:
    -- The `INSTEAD OF` trigger is used because `current_collections` is a view, and views in SQLite are not inherently writable.
    -- This trigger intercepts `INSERT` operations and provides a custom implementation.
-- **Condition (`WHEN` Clause)**:
    -- The `WHEN` clause checks if the `NEW.accession_number` exists in the `collections` table.
-- **Trigger Body**:
    -- Instead of performing an actual insert, the trigger updates the `deleted` column of the existing record in the `collections` table, setting it to `0`, effectively reactivating the record.
-- **Semicolons**:
    -- Semicolons are used to terminate SQL statements in SQLite. You don't need a semicolon after `END`, as it is the end of the trigger definition, but you need it after the `UPDATE` statement inside the trigger.



CREATE TRIGGER "update_current_collections"
INSTEAD OF UPDATE ON "current_collections"
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    -- Update the base table "collections" with new data
    UPDATE "collections"
    SET 
        "title" = NEW."title",
        "year" = NEW."year"
    WHERE "id" = OLD."id";
END;
-- **Trigger Type**:
    -- `INSTEAD OF UPDATE` triggers intercept `UPDATE` operations on the view and define a custom behavior.
-- **Trigger Body**:
    -- The `UPDATE` statement modifies the corresponding record in the `collections` table based on the `id` from the old row (`OLD.id`) and new values (`NEW.title`, `NEW.year`).
-- **`NEW` and `OLD`:
    -- `NEW` refers to the new values being updated.
    -- `OLD` refers to the existing values in the view.
-- **Behavior**:
    -- When an `UPDATE` statement is executed on the view, the trigger updates the base table `collections` instead of directly modifying the view.
```

### Notes:
- You can not update the view, because it doesn't have any data inside it exactly but it only pulls data from tables.
- **Physical partitioning** refers to how data is stored on disk, where a large table might be split into multiple physical segments for performance optimization. What you're doing with views is more about organizing data for easier querying, without actually changing how it's physically stored.
- In SQLite, I can't set access control, means I can give you an access to the entire db or nothing. But, in other DBMSes, I can do that .
