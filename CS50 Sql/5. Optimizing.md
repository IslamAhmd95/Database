### Optimizing

```sql
-- to measure how much time the query takes to run, run this command to time my future queries in sqlite
.timer on
```

In this section, the instructor introduced the concept of query optimization using an example from the **IMDB database**, which includes four tables:
- `movies`
- `rating`
- `people`
- `stars`

To demonstrate, a query was written to fetch a movie called _"Cars"_, and the execution time was measured using `.timer on`.

The instructor explained that the query's performance depends on how data is searched. A **linear search** (scanning each row sequentially) is often used when no optimization is applied. However, this method is inefficient, especially for large datasets.

To illustrate this, the instructor compared it to finding a specific page in a book. Instead of flipping through every page (linear search), a faster approach is to use the **index** at the beginning of the book. This analogy sets the foundation for understanding indexing, which is discussed in the next section.

### Indexes
A structure used to speed up the retrieval of rows from the table.
Indexes improve query performance by avoiding linear searches and allowing faster lookups, similar to a book's index.

```sql
-- Syntax
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name, ...);

SELECT * FROM "movies" WHERE "title" = 'Cars';  -- Runtime = .084
-- The query performs a **linear search**, scanning each row in the table sequentially.

-- This creates an index for the `title` column, allowing faster lookups.
CREATE INDEX "title_index" ON "movies" ("title");
-- now let's search for the movie
SELECT * FROM "movies" WHERE "title" = 'Cars';  -- Runtime = .001
```

-- -

### Query Plans

```sql
-- Syntax for SQLite
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN query;


EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM "movies" WHERE "title" = 'Cars'
-- OUTPUT:
	-- QUERY PLAN
	-- SEARCH movies USING INDEX title_index (title=?)


DROP INDEX "title_index";

EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM "movies" WHERE "title" = 'Cars'
-- OUTPUT:
	-- QUERY PLAN
	-- SCAN movies
-- scanning means to go top to bottom through that column title and find all the rows that have 'Cars' on them

-- Creating a primary key like "id" will make an index on that column "id" automatically
```

#### Why should not we create an index for every column we have ?
There are some trade-offs involving space and also the time it later takes to insert new data.

#### 1. **Increased Storage Space**
- **Indexes Consume Space:** Each index is a separate data structure that requires additional disk space.
- If you create an index for every column, the storage requirements for the database increase significantly, especially for large datasets.

#### 2. **Slower Insert, Update, and Delete Operations**
- **Index Maintenance Overhead:**  
    When new data is inserted or existing data is updated/deleted, the database must update all relevant indexes.
    - More indexes mean more time spent maintaining them.
    - For write-heavy databases, excessive indexing can degrade performance.

#### 3. **Diminishing Returns**
- **Not All Columns Are Queried Equally:**
    - Many columns are rarely or never used in queries.
    - Creating indexes on such columns provides little to no benefit while still incurring storage and maintenance costs.

#### 4. **Query Optimization Complexity**
- **Index Selection:**
    - If there are too many indexes, the query optimizer may take longer to decide which index to use.
    - This can sometimes lead to suboptimal "دون المستوى الأمثل" query plans.

### Covering Indexes
A **covering index** is a special type of index that contains all the columns needed to fulfill a query, so the database doesn’t need to access the main table (known as a "table lookup").

For example:

- A regular index includes only the indexed column(s), like `person_id` in `stars`.
- A covering index includes additional columns that are frequently used in queries, like both `person_id` and `movie_id`.

Covering indexes can improve performance by reducing the number of steps required to retrieve data.

```sql
SELECT movies.title  
FROM movies  
JOIN stars ON movies.id = stars.movie_id  
JOIN people ON stars.person_id = people.id  
WHERE people.name = 'Tom Hanks';


select title from movies where id in (
	select movie_id from stars where person_id = (
		select id from people where name = 'tom hanks'
	)
);

EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
select title from movies where id in (
	select movie_id from stars where person_id = (
		select id from people where name = 'tom hanks'
	)
);


-- Before creating indexes, the database performs a full table scan for `people` and `stars`, which is inefficient for large datasets.
CREATE INDEX "person_index" ON "stars" ("person_id");
CREATE INDEX "name_index" ON "people" ("name");
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
select title from movies where id in (
	select movie_id from stars where person_id = (
		select id from people where name = 'tom hanks'
	)
);
-- After indexing, the query plan shows that the database uses the indexes to speed up the search:
-- The `name_index` is used to quickly locate _Tom Hanks_ in the `people` table.
-- The `person_index` allows fast lookups of the associated `person_id` in the `stars` table.


-- Again, we noticed that the query still required additional lookups on the `stars` table to retrieve `movie_id`.
-- To optimize this, they dropped the initial `person_index` and created a **compound index** on both `person_id` and `movie_id`:
DROP INDEX "person_index";
CREATE INDEX "person_movie_index" ON "stars" ("person_id", "movie_id");
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN
select title from movies where id in (
	select movie_id from stars where person_id = (
		select id from people where name = 'tom hanks'
	)
);
-- This compound index became a **covering index** for the subquery on `stars`.
-- **Output:** After running `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` again, the query now used **2 covering indices**:
	-- 1. `name_index` for `people.name`.
	-- 2. `person_movie_index` for both `person_id` and `movie_id`.

-- Why Are Covering Indexes Better?
	-- Covering indexes reduce the need for the database to access the table data. For this query:
		-- Without a covering index, the database looks up the `movie_id` in the `stars` table after finding rows using `person_id`.
		-- With a covering index, both `person_id` and `movie_id` are stored together in the index, eliminating the extra table lookup.
```

#### Regular Index vs. Covering Index

##### 1. **Regular Index**

- **Definition:** An index that includes only the specified columns used for lookups (e.g., `person_id` in `stars`).
- **Behavior:**
    - Helps the database quickly locate rows that match the query condition.
    - After finding the matching rows, the database still needs to access the main table to retrieve additional columns (a "table lookup").
- **Example:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX person_index ON stars(person_id);
-- This speeds up filtering by `person_id`, but the database must look up `movie_id` in the main table if needed.
```

| person_id | row_id of the stars table |
| :-------: | :-----------------------: |
|    101    |             1             |
|    102    |             2             |
|    103    |             3             |

##### 2. **Covering Index**

- **Definition:** An index that includes all the columns needed to satisfy a query.
- **Behavior:**
    - Avoids the need for a table lookup because the index itself contains all the required data.
    - This reduces the number of I/O operations and improves query performance.
- **Example:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX person_movie_index ON stars(person_id, movie_id);
-- This index covers queries that need both `person_id` and `movie_id`, eliminating the need to access the `stars` table.
```

| person_id | movie_id | row_id of the stars table |
| :-------: | :------: | :-----------------------: |
|    101    |   201    |             1             |
|    102    |   202    |             2             |
|    103    |   203    |             3             |

### B-Tree
A **B-Tree** (short for Balanced Tree) is a specialized data structure designed to optimize searches, insertions, and deletions in a database. It is widely used in database indices due to its efficiency in handling large datasets.

#### Key Features of B-Tree:

1. **Sorted Structure**: Data is stored in a sorted manner, allowing for efficient searching.
2. **Hierarchical Nodes**:
    - The tree has multiple levels (root, intermediate nodes, and leaf nodes).
    - Each node contains keys (data values) and pointers to child nodes.
3. **Balanced**:
    - All leaf nodes are at the same level, ensuring consistent performance for searches.
4. **Binary-Like Search**:
    - Each node is searched in a way similar to **binary search**.
    - Decisions to go "left" or "right" are based on comparisons with keys in the node.


#### Cons of Using B-Tree Indexing

1. **Increased Space Usage:**
    - Indexes require additional storage separate from the table.
    - A B-Tree must store the keys (e.g., movie titles) and pointers to the actual data in the table.
    - The more indexes you create, the more storage is consumed.
2. **Overhead for Insertions and Deletions:**
    - When you **insert** or **delete** rows in the table, the corresponding B-Tree index needs to be updated.
    - Updates involve reorganizing the tree:
        - **Insertions** may require splitting nodes if they become too full.
        - **Deletions** may require merging nodes if they become too empty.
    - This reorganization can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets or frequent updates.
3. **Performance Trade-offs:**
    - While indexes improve **read performance** (search queries), they can degrade **write performance** (insert, update, delete operations).
    - For tables with heavy write operations, too many indexes can slow things down.

#### Example:

 **Search for "Titanic":**
 
![[Pasted image 20250104191345.png]]

1. Start at the root node `[Cars, Matrix]`.
2. Compare "Titanic" with "Cars" and "Matrix".
    - "Titanic" > "Matrix" → Move to the third child node.
3. In the third child node `[Titanic]`, locate "Titanic".


#### Relation Between B-Tree and Index:

1. **How B-Trees Help Indices**:
    - Indices are implemented using B-Trees to make searches efficient.
    - Instead of scanning the entire table (linear search), a B-Tree index allows jumping between nodes to locate the desired record.
2. **Benefits of Using B-Tree in Indices**:
    - **Fast Search**: Searching in a B-Tree is `O(log N)` compared to `O(N)` for linear search.
    - **Ordered Data**: B-Trees maintain the order of the indexed column, enabling range queries (`BETWEEN`, `>`, `<`) to be efficient.
    - **Efficient Updates**: Insertions and deletions in B-Trees are efficient and keep the tree balanced.
3. **Example in SQL**:
    - Table: `movies(id, title)`
    - Index: `CREATE INDEX title_index ON movies(title);`
    - When you run `SELECT * FROM movies WHERE title = 'Titanic';`
		The database uses the B-Tree structure of the `title_index` to locate "Titanic" efficiently.
	
#### Summary    

  - **Without Indexes (Table Scan):**
    - The database searches the table by scanning row by row and column by column to find the requested data.
    - This approach, called **linear search**, is slow for large datasets.
- **With Regular Index:**
    - A regular index creates a separate structure (using a B-Tree) for one or more specific columns in the query.
    - The database can quickly locate rows matching the query using the index.
    - However, the index may not contain all the columns needed for the query, so the database has to access the main table to fetch additional data (called a **table lookup**).
- **With Covering Index:**
    - A covering index includes all the columns required for the query within the index itself.
    - This eliminates the need for table lookups, as all the necessary data is in the index.
    - This makes covering indices faster than regular indices for queries they are designed to handle.
- **The Role of B-Trees in Indexing:**
    - B-Trees are the underlying data structure used by both regular and covering indices.
    - They organize data in a sorted, hierarchical manner, allowing for efficient searches, insertions, and deletions.
    - Searching in a B-Tree involves:
        - Starting from the root node.
        - Comparing the query value with keys in the node.
        - Moving to child nodes based on the comparison, narrowing the search range.
    - For very large datasets, B-Trees split the sorted data into smaller nodes (pages), reducing the number of comparisons needed.

### Partial Index
A **partial index** is an index created with a condition to include only a subset of rows in a table. Unlike a regular index, which indexes all rows in a column, a partial index indexes only rows that meet a specific condition. This reduces the index's size and maintenance overhead, making it efficient for queries targeting that subset of data.


```sql
-- Syntax
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name, ...) WHERE condition;

-- Example
CREATE INDEX recent_movies ON movies (title) WHERE release_year = 2023;
-- This index will only include rows where `release_year = 2023`. The resulting index contains:
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE release_year = 2023;
-- The database uses the **`recent_movies`** index.
-- The query is fast because the partial index is small and only includes the relevant rows.
```

#### **Why Use Partial Indexes?**

- **Smaller Size:** They consume less storage than a full index.
- **Faster Maintenance:** They are quicker to update since they only involve a subset of rows.
- **Targeted Optimization:** Ideal for queries that frequently filter by specific conditions (e.g., recent movies, active users, etc.).

#### **Why Could Queries Be Faster Without an Index?**

1. **Small Table Size:**
    - If the `movies` table is small, scanning the table entirely may take less time than checking the index and fetching rows.
2. **Query Execution Overhead:**
    - Using an index introduces overhead for determining whether the index applies and then fetching rows from the table.
    - For rows not in the index (e.g., movies from 1998), the database cannot use the index at all.
3. **Selective Use of Indexes:**
    - Indexes are most beneficial when the condition they cover is selective (i.e., filters a small subset of rows).
    - If a condition matches many rows (or all rows, like `1998` in a small dataset), a full table scan may be as efficient or even faster.

### Vacuum

In SQLite, the **VACUUM** command is used to reclaim "إستعادة" unused space in the database and optimize its file size. Over time, as data is inserted, updated, or deleted, the database file can become fragmented "مجزأة", leaving unused space that is still part of the database file.

#### Syntax:
```sql
VACUUM;
```

#### Allocated vs. De-allocated Space

1. **Allocated Space:**
    - This is the space **assigned** to the database file, including the space used for storing actual data and unused space from deleted or updated rows.
    - When you delete or drop data (e.g., rows or indexes), SQLite marks the space as **de-allocated**, but it doesn't shrink the database file immediately.
2. **De-allocated Space:**
    - Space that is no longer used by active data but is still part of the database file.
    - This space can be reused for new data without increasing the file size but isn't released back to the operating system.


#### Why the Size Didn't Decrease After Dropping Indexes

When you drop indexes (or delete data), the space they occupied is **de-allocated**:
- SQLite doesn't immediately shrink "يتقلص" the database file.
- Instead, it keeps the de-allocated space reserved for future data additions.
  
  The file size remains the same because SQLite prioritizes performance by avoiding frequent file resizing operations, which can be slow.
  
#### What Happens When You Run VACUUM?

The **VACUUM** command:

1. Creates a new, temporary database file.
2. Copies all active (used) data from the original database to the temporary file, leaving out the de-allocated space.
3. Replaces the original database file with the new, smaller file.

This process effectively:

- The **DBMS (SQLite)** handles reclaiming space by reorganizing the data.
- Once the smaller file replaces the original, the **Operating System** regains the unused space.
- Optimizes the database file by eliminating fragmentation.
- Ensures that all data is compactly stored.

#### VACUUM in Other Databases

While VACUUM is specific to SQLite, other database systems have similar mechanisms to reclaim space and optimize performance:

1. **PostgreSQL:**
    
    - Uses **`VACUUM`** and **`VACUUM FULL`**.
    - **`VACUUM`:** Reclaims space and makes it available for reuse without reducing the database size.
    - **`VACUUM FULL`:** Reclaims space and shrinks the database file size.
      
2. **MySQL (InnoDB):**
    
    - Uses **`OPTIMIZE TABLE`**.
    - This defragments the table and reclaims unused space.
      
3. **SQL Server:**
    
    - Uses **`DBCC SHRINKDATABASE`** or **`DBCC SHRINKFILE`** to reclaim and reduce space.
      
4. **Oracle:**
    
    - Uses **`ALTER TABLE ... SHRINK SPACE`** for similar purposes.
      
  ---


### Transaction
A **transaction** in a database is a group of one or more operations (queries) executed as a single unit. Transactions ensure that either all operations succeed or none are applied to the database, maintaining **data integrity**.

#### Alice and Bob Example

**Initial State:**

- Alice has **10 USD**.
- Bob has **20 USD**.

**Goal:** Alice transfers **10 USD** to Bob.

**Steps:**
1. Start Transaction
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
```

2. Perform Operations:
```sql
-- Update Alice's balance:
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 10 WHERE name = 'Alice';
-- Update Bob's balance:
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 10 WHERE name = 'Bob';
```

3. Validate Operations: 
   Before committing, check if constraints (e.g., negative balance) are violated. For example, Alice cannot give more money than her balance.
   
4. Decide to Commit or Rollback:
   - If all operations succeed without violating constraints:
```sql
COMMIT;
-- This saves all changes to the database.
```
 
   - If any operation fails or violates constraints:
```sql
ROLLBACK;
-- This undoes all changes made since the transaction started.
```


#### In a PHP script, you can use **exception handling** to determine whether to commit or rollback.

```php
try {
    $pdo->beginTransaction(); // Start transaction

    // Deduct money from Alice
    $pdo->exec("UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 10 WHERE name = 'Alice'");

    // Check if Alice's balance is valid
    $result = $pdo->query("SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE name = 'Alice'")->fetch();
    if ($result['balance'] < 0) {
        throw new Exception("Insufficient balance for Alice");
    }

    // Add money to Bob
    $pdo->exec("UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 10 WHERE name = 'Bob'");

    // If all operations succeed, commit the transaction
    $pdo->commit();
    echo "Transaction successful!";
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // If any operation fails, rollback the transaction
    $pdo->rollBack();
    echo "Transaction failed: " . $e->getMessage();
}
```


#### ACID Properties
A **transaction** in a database must achieve the **ACID** properties to ensure that data integrity is maintained, even in the face of concurrent operations, constraints, or unexpected failures.

Here’s how the **ACID** properties apply to the example of Alice and Bob transferring money:

##### **1. Atomicity**

- **Definition:** Either all operations in the transaction complete successfully, or none are applied. Partial changes are not allowed.
    
- **Example:**
    
    - Operation 1: Deduct **10 USD** from Alice.
    - Operation 2: Add **10 USD** to Bob.
    - If **Operation 2** fails (e.g., due to a system crash), **Operation 1** must also be undone to maintain atomicity.
    - **Result:**
        - If both succeed: Alice's balance is **0**, Bob's is **30**.
        - If either fails: Neither change is applied, and Alice's balance remains **10**, Bob's **20**.
          
##### **2. Consistency**

- **Definition:** The database must remain in a valid state before and after the transaction, adhering to all defined rules (e.g., no negative balances).
    
- **Example:**
    
    - **Valid State:** Alice cannot have a balance less than **0** after the transaction.
    - If Alice attempts to transfer **15 USD** (while having only **10 USD**), the transaction violates the rule and should be rolled back.
    - **Result:** The database remains consistent:
        - Before: Alice's balance **10**, Bob's **20**.
        - After: Either **0 & 30** (successful transfer) or no change (transaction aborted).

##### **3. Isolation**

- **Definition:** Transactions must not interfere with each other. Each transaction should occur as if it were the only one being executed.
    
- **Example:**
    
    - Suppose two transactions occur simultaneously:
        1. Alice transfers **10 USD** to Bob.
        2. Alice transfers **5 USD** to Charlie.
    - If these transactions are not isolated, Alice's balance could become inconsistent (e.g., debited twice before Bob or Charlie's balances are updated).
    - **Isolation ensures:**
        - Transaction 1 runs independently, updating Alice and Bob's balances.
        - Only after Transaction 1 completes can Transaction 2 start.

##### **4. Durability**

- **Definition:** Once a transaction is committed, its changes are permanent, even in the event of a system failure.
    
- **Example:**
    
    - After Alice successfully transfers **10 USD** to Bob:
        - The changes (Alice’s balance **0**, Bob’s **30**) are committed to the database.
    - Even if a power outage or crash occurs immediately after the commit, the changes remain intact when the system restarts.


---

### Race Conditions
A **race condition** occurs when multiple transactions or processes access and manipulate the same data concurrently, and the outcome depends on the timing or order of their execution. This can lead to inconsistent or incorrect results if proper safeguards (like transaction isolation) are not in place.

#### Example: Charlie and Alice

##### Scenario

- Charlie has $30 in his account.
- Charlie attempts to send **$30** to Alice **twice** simultaneously "معا" (via two separate transactions).
- Let's see how this might cause a problem due to a race condition.

##### Step-by-Step Illustration

1. **Initial State:**
    - Charlie: $30
    - Alice: $0
2. **Two Transactions Start Simultaneously:**
    - **Transaction 1 (T1):** Deduct $30 from Charlie and add $30 to Alice.
    - **Transaction 2 (T2):** Deduct another $30 from Charlie and add another $30 to Alice.
3. **Execution Without Isolation:**
    - Both transactions check Charlie’s balance at the same time: **$30**.
    - Both proceed, thinking there is enough money in Charlie’s account.
    - **T1:** Deducts $30, leaving Charlie with $0, and adds $30 to Alice.
    - **T2:** Deducts another $30, resulting in **negative $30** (invalid state), and adds $30 more to Alice.
4. **Final State:**
    - Charlie: **$-30** (invalid state).
    - Alice: $60 (incorrect because Charlie only had $30).


| Account | Balance |
| ------- | ------- |
| Charlie | 30$     |
| Alice   | 0$      |

```sql
-- T1: Transfer $30 from Charlie to Alice
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 30 WHERE name = 'Charlie';
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 30 WHERE name = 'Alice';
COMMIT;

-- T2: Transfer another $30 from Charlie to Alice
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 30 WHERE name = 'Charlie';
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 30 WHERE name = 'Alice';
COMMIT;
```

| Account | Balance |
| ------- | ------- |
| Charlie | -30$    |
| Alice   | 60$     |

#### Why Hackers Exploit "يستغل" This ?

- A hacker might deliberately exploit "يستغل عمدا" this by sending multiple concurrent requests (e.g., to transfer money or place orders) faster than the database can verify the balance or availability.
- Without proper safeguards, the system processes all requests as if sufficient funds or inventory exist, leading to unauthorized gains.
  
---

### Locks
Locks are mechanisms used by databases to manage concurrent access to data, ensuring data integrity and consistency, Prevent conflicts when multiple transactions access or modify the same data simultaneously.


#### **Types of Locks in SQLite**

1. **Deferred Lock (Default Mode)**:
    
    - **Behavior**:
        - Starts with **no lock**.
        - Allows other transactions to **read and write** until the first write occurs.
        - **First write** applies a **Reserved Lock**, preventing others from writing.
    - **Example**:
        1. **Transaction A** starts (Deferred): no locks yet.
        2. **Transaction B** starts (Deferred): no locks yet.
        3. **Transaction A writes**: Reserved Lock → **Transaction B cannot write but can still read**.
    - **Syntax:**
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- Read and write operations here
COMMIT;
```

2. **Shared Lock**:
    
    - **Behavior**:
        - Starts with a **Shared Lock**:
            - Allows others to **read** but **prevents writing**.
        - **First write** applies a **Reserved Lock**, preventing others from writing.
    - **Example**:
        1. **Transaction A** starts (Shared): locks the table for reading.
        2. **Transaction B** starts (Shared): can read but not write.
        3. **Transaction A writes**: Reserved Lock → **No other writes allowed, but reading is still fine**.
    - **Syntax:**
```sql
BEGIN IMMEDIATE TRANSACTION;
-- Read operations here
-- Write applies a Reserved Lock
COMMIT;
```

3. **Exclusive Lock**:
    
    - **Behavior**:
        - Starts with an **Exclusive Lock**:
            - Blocks **all reads** and **all writes** by other transactions.
        - No other transaction can begin until the current one completes.
    - **Example**:
        1. **Transaction A** starts (Exclusive): locks the database completely.
        2. **Transaction B** tries to start: it’s blocked until **Transaction A finishes**.
    - **Syntax:**
```sql
BEGIN EXCLUSIVE TRANSACTION;
-- Prevents all other reads and writes
-- Write operations here
COMMIT;
```


![[Pasted image 20250105133108.png]]

#### **Additional Concepts**

1. **Reserved Lock**:
    
    - Automatically applied in **Deferred** and **Shared** modes **when a write occurs**.
    - Prevents other transactions from writing but still allows reading.
2. **Lock Escalation**:
    
    - Locks may escalate (become stricter) as transactions progress:
        - **Shared Lock → Reserved Lock → Exclusive Lock** (depending on operations).


#### **Key Points to Remember**

1. **Locks Escalate, Not Downgrade**:
    - A transaction can escalate its lock (e.g., from **Shared** to **Reserved**) but cannot downgrade it.
2. **Stricter Locks Have Priority**:
    - An **Exclusive Lock** request will wait until all lower-priority locks are released.
3. **Precedence Does Not Matter**:
    - Even if a **Deferred** or **Shared** transaction starts first, a stricter lock (e.g., **Exclusive**) will eventually block them when granted.
      

#### **Why Priority Over Precedence "الأسبقية" ?**

- Databases prioritize the **type of lock** to maintain **data consistency** and **integrity** over fairness.
- This ensures critical transactions (e.g., backups, large updates) complete without interference.

#### Deadlock
A **deadlock** is like two people blocking each other because both are waiting for the other to move first. This happens in databases, including SQLite, when two or more transactions (jobs working on the database) get stuck because they are waiting for each other to release resources (like rows or tables) they need to continue.

##### Simple Example of a Deadlock

Imagine two friends, Alice and Bob, want to borrow pens and erasers from each other:

1. Alice picks up a pen but also needs an eraser.
2. Bob picks up an eraser but also needs a pen.
3. Alice can’t finish until Bob gives her the eraser, but Bob can’t finish until Alice gives him the pen.

Neither can continue, so they’re stuck—this is a deadlock.
  
##### Deadlock in SQLite

In SQLite, a deadlock happens when two transactions are trying to access resources in a way that blocks each other.

###### Database Example:

1. **Transaction A** locks **Row 1** for editing.
2. **Transaction B** locks **Row 2** for editing.
3. Now, **Transaction A** tries to lock **Row 2**, but it’s already locked by **Transaction B**, so it has to wait.
4. At the same time, **Transaction B** tries to lock **Row 1**, but it’s locked by **Transaction A**, so it also has to wait.

Both transactions are stuck because they are waiting for each other to finish first.


##### How SQLite Solves Deadlocks

SQLite solves this by "breaking the cycle." When it detects a deadlock:

- It cancels (rolls back) one of the transactions.
- The canceled transaction can try again later, freeing up the blocked resources.

##### How to Avoid Deadlocks

1. **Access Data in the Same Order**:
    
    - If every transaction works on **Row 1** first and then **Row 2**, they won’t block each other.
2. **Keep Transactions Short**:
    
    - Finish your work quickly so others don’t have to wait long for resources.
3. **Use Explicit Locks**:
    
    - Use commands like `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` to grab the necessary locks upfront, avoiding surprises later.
