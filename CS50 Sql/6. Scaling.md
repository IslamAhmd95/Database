### Server-Based DBs vs Serverless DBs

#### 1. MySQL and PostgreSQL (Server-Based Databases)

- **Server Requirement**:  
    Both MySQL and PostgreSQL run as database servers. This means:
    - They need a **server process** running to manage connections and handle queries.
    - The database client (e.g., your application or a SQL client) communicates with the database server.
- **Connection Over Network**:
    - These databases can be accessed **locally** (on the same machine) or **remotely** over a network or the internet.
    - Internet or network access is only necessary if your application is hosted on a separate machine from the database.
- **Use Case**:
    - Best for multi-user, large-scale applications where many clients or systems need concurrent access.

#### 2. SQLite (Serverless Database)

- **Serverless Design**:
    - SQLite doesn’t require a server process. Instead, the database is stored in a simple file on disk (e.g., `data.db`).
    - Applications interact with the SQLite database **directly via a library** embedded in the application.
- **No Network Needed**:
    - SQLite operates entirely **locally** on the same machine as your application.
    - You don’t need the internet or a network to access SQLite.
- **Use Case**:
    - Ideal for lightweight, single-user applications or systems where simplicity and portability are priorities.

### MySQL

```sql
-- connecting to mysql server
mysql -u root -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -p
-- **`mysql`**:  
    -- The MySQL command-line client tool used to connect and interact with the MySQL server.
    
-- **`-u root`**:  
    -- Specifies the username for the connection. In this case, it's `root` (the default admin user in MySQL).
    
-- **`-h 127.0.0.1`**:  
    -- Specifies the host where the MySQL server is running.
    
    -- `127.0.0.1` means "localhost" or the local machine.
    -- If the server is on another machine, replace `127.0.0.1` with the remote server's IP or hostname.
-- **`-P 3306`**:  
    -- Specifies the port number to connect to.
    
    -- `3306` is the default MySQL port.
    -- If your MySQL server uses a non-default port, replace this value with the appropriate port number.
-- **`-p`**:  
    -- Prompts you to enter the password for the specified user.
    
    -- After typing this command, you'll be asked to input the password securely.


CREATE DATABASE `mbta`;  -- we usually use back ticks in mysql and double quotes in sqlite .

SHOW DATABASES;

USE `mbta`;

CREATE TABLE `cards` (
	`id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
	PRIMARY KEY(`id`)
);
-- In mysql, I have to use 'AUTO_INCREMENT' with the 'PRIMARY KEY' but in sqlite 'PRIMARY KEY' constraint is enough to handle it for me .
-- MySQL supports the `SERIAL` keyword, but it’s essentially shorthand for `BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT UNIQUE`.

SHOW TABLES;

DESCRIBE `cards`;

CREATE TABLE `stations` (
	`id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
	`name` VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
	`line` ENUM('blue', 'green', 'orange', 'red') NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY(`id`)
);

DESCRIBE `stations`;

-- ENUM  vs SET
	-- Use **`ENUM`** if:
	    -- The field should only ever have **one value** from the predefined list.
	    -- Example: `'status'` of an order (`'pending'`, `'completed'`, etc.).
	-- Use **`SET`** if:
	    -- The field needs to store **multiple values** from the predefined list.
	    -- Example: `'tags'` for a blog post (`'tech'`, `'AI'`, `'PHP'`, etc.).

CREATE TABLE `swips` (
	`id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
	`card_id` INT,
	`station_id` INT,
	`type` ENUM('enter', 'exit', 'deposit') NOT NULL,
	`datetime` DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
	`amount` DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL CHECK(`amount` != 0),
	PRIMARY KEY(`id`),
	FOREIGN KEY(`card_id`) REFERENCES `cards`(`id`),
	FOREIGN KEY(`station_id`) REFERENCES `stations`(`id`)
);
-- DECIMAL(5,2) = 5 digits all and 2 only after the decimal point

DESCRIBE `swips`;
-- sometimes I have 'MUL' value under 'key' column in front of the foreign keys which means this field can accept the same value multiple times .

ALTER TABLE `stations` MODIFY `line` ENUM('blue', 'green', 'orange', 'red', 'silver') NOT NULL;
```

#### Stored Procedures in MySQL
A **stored procedure** is a set of SQL statements that are stored in the database and can be executed as a single unit. They are useful for encapsulating logic, improving performance, and reducing network traffic.

##### Syntax
```sql
DELIMITER $$  -- change the delimiter to "$$", because I need to use ";" with the queries inside the procedure 

CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name (parameters)
BEGIN
    -- SQL statements;
END$$  -- using the delimiter "$$"

DELIMITER ;  -- return to ";"
```

##### Examples:
```sql
-- Example1
CREATE TABLE `collections` (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

ALTER TABLE `collections`
ADD COLUMN deleted TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 0;

INSERT INTO `collections` (title) VALUES 
('Item A'), 
('Item B'), 
('Item C');

-- create the procedure
DELIMITER $$  -- change the delimiter to "$$", because I need to use ";" with the queries inside the procedure 
CREATE PROCEDURE `current_collections`()
BEGIN
    SELECT title FROM `collections` WHERE `deleted` = 0;
END$$  -- using the delimiter "$$"
DELIMITER ;  -- return to ";"

-- Call the procedure
CALL `current_collections`();


-- Example2
CREATE TABLE `transactions` (
	`id` INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
	`title` VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
	`action` ENUM('bought', 'sold') NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY(`id`)
);

-- create procedure to sell "collections" by "id" and insert them to "transactions" table
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE `sell`(IN `sold_id` INT)  -- IN means input, INT is datatype
BEGIN
	UPDATE `collections` SET `deleted` = 1 
	WHERE `id`=`sold_id`;
	INSERT INTO `transactions` (`title`, `action`)
	VALUES
	((SELECT `title` FROM `collections` WHERE `id`=`sold_id`), 'sold');
END//
DELIMITER ;

-- sell item with "id" = 2 from "collections"
CALL `sell`(2);
```

##### Can Stored Procedures Accept Multiple Values?

Yes, stored procedures in MySQL can accept multiple input values (parameters). You can define multiple parameters in the procedure definition, separated by commas. These parameters can be:

- **IN**: For input values (default).
- **OUT**: For output values that the procedure modifies.
- **INOUT**: For parameters used as both input and output.
  
##### Can Stored Procedures Return Values?

Stored procedures in MySQL **do not return values directly** like functions in some programming languages. However, you can achieve a similar effect by:

1. Using **OUT parameters** to pass values back to the caller.
2. Using **SELECT statements** to return result sets.

If you need a direct return of a single value, you might want to use a **function** instead of a procedure.

##### Examples:
```sql
-- Example: A Procedure to Update Multiple Items by ID
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE `update_multiple_collections`(IN `id1` INT, IN `id2` INT, IN `new_title1` VARCHAR(100), IN `new_title2` VARCHAR(100))
BEGIN
    UPDATE `collections` 
    SET `title` = new_title1
    WHERE `id` = id1;

    UPDATE `collections` 
    SET `title` = new_title2
    WHERE `id` = id2;
END$$

DELIMITER ;
-- Call the Procedure:
CALL `update_multiple_collections`(1, 3, 'Updated Item A', 'Updated Item C');



-- A Procedure to Return the Title of an Item by ID
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE `get_collection_title`(IN `collection_id` INT, OUT `collection_title` VARCHAR(100))
BEGIN
    SELECT `title` INTO `collection_title`
    FROM `collections`
    WHERE `id` = `collection_id`;
END$$

DELIMITER ;
-- Call the Procedure:
CALL `get_collection_title`(1, @title);
SELECT @title;
-- **Output**: The value of the `title` column for the item with ID = 1 is stored in the session variable `@title`.



-- A Procedure to Fetch Titles of Non-Deleted Items
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE `fetch_non_deleted`()
BEGIN
    SELECT `title` FROM `collections` WHERE `deleted` = 0;
END$$

DELIMITER ;
-- Call the Procedure:
CALL `fetch_non_deleted`();
-- This will return a result set directly, which can be processed by the client application.



-- **When to Use Functions Instead of Procedures**
-- If you need to directly return a value (like a scalar or aggregate), use a **function**. Functions are more suited for single value returns.

-- Example: Function to Return the Count of Non-Deleted Items
DELIMITER $$

CREATE FUNCTION `count_non_deleted`()
RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    DECLARE non_deleted_count INT;
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO non_deleted_count FROM `collections` WHERE `deleted` = 0;
    RETURN non_deleted_count;
END$$

DELIMITER ;
-- Call the Function:
SELECT `count_non_deleted`();
```

---

### PostgreSQL

```sql
-- show databases
\l    -- maybe l for list

-- create a database
CREATE DATABASE "mbta";

-- use "mbta" database
\c "mbta"

-- show "bmta" tables
\dt    -- maybe d for describe and t for tables

-- create table
CREATE TABLE "cards" (  -- We usually use double quotes like Sqlite
	"id" SERIAL,  -- SERIAL for auto-increments integers in postgresql
	PRIMARY KEY("id")
);

-- describe table "cards"
\d "cards"   -- maybe d for describe

-- create table
CREATE TABLE "cards" (  -- We usually use double quotes like Sqlite
	"id" SERIAL,  -- SERIAL for auto-increments integers in postgresql
	"name" VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
	"line" VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY("id")
);

-- create table swips
-- first we need to create type "swip_type" separately
CREATE TYPE "swip_type" AS ENUM('enter', 'exit', 'deposit'); 
-- **What is `CREATE TYPE`?**  
-- In PostgreSQL, `CREATE TYPE` is used to define a custom data type. It doesn't create a column but instead defines a reusable **data type** that you can use in one or more tables.

-- In your query, `swip_type` is defined as an `ENUM` type with the allowed values `'enter'`, `'exit'`, and `'deposit'`.
-- This custom type can then be used in a column definition (`type` column in your table "swips").

-- second we create the table
CREATE TABLE "swips" (
    "id" SERIAL,
    "card_id" INT,
    "station_id" INT,
    "type" "swip_type" NOT NULL,  -- Use the custom ENUM type
    "datetime" TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    "amount" NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL CHECK ("amount" != 0),  -- Ensure amount is non-zero
    PRIMARY KEY ("id"),
    FOREIGN KEY ("card_id") REFERENCES "cards"("id"),
    FOREIGN KEY ("station_id") REFERENCES "stations"("id")
);

-- check the custome type we just created "swip_type"
SELECT typname, enumlabel 
FROM pg_type
JOIN pg_enum ON pg_type.oid = pg_enum.enumtypid
WHERE typname = 'swip_type';
-- output:
	-- a table of 2 columns (typname, enumlabel) and 3 records
	-- typname will be always "swip_type" and enumlabel will be "enter", "exit", "deposit"



-- exit postgresql session
\q 
```

### Scaling and Replication in Distributed Systems

#### Scaling

##### Vertical Scaling
- **Definition**: Vertical scaling, also known as **scaling up**, means increasing the capacity of a single machine by adding more resources such as CPU, RAM, or storage. It involves upgrading the hardware of the server hosting your database or application.
- **Example**: Moving from a server with 16GB RAM and 4 CPUs to one with 64GB RAM and 16 CPUs.
- **Pros**:
    1. Simpler to implement as it requires no changes to the application or architecture.
    2. Consistent performance, as there's no distribution of data across multiple servers.
- **Cons**:
    1. Limited by the hardware’s maximum capacity (a single machine can only scale so far).
    2. Downtime may be required during upgrades.
       
##### Horizontal Scaling
- **Definition**: Horizontal scaling (also called **scale-out**) involves adding more servers or instances to distribute the load across multiple machines, rather than upgrading a single server (vertical scaling). It's a broader concept that can apply to various types of systems, including databases, web servers, or application servers.
- **Example**: In a **sharded** database, different shards handle different portions of the data, allowing both read and write operations to be handled by separate servers, thus improving performance and scaling.
- **Pros**: Horizontal scaling is useful when the workload grows beyond the capacity of a single server and you need to distribute both the read and write traffic.
- **Cons**: Horizontal scaling can be complex to implement, particularly with sharding, because it requires managing data distribution, maintaining consistency, and ensuring fault tolerance.

##### Sharding
 
 **Definition:**

- **Description**: **Sharding** is a way of splitting your database into smaller, more manageable pieces called **shards**. Each shard contains a subset of the data, and typically each shard is stored on a separate machine or server. This is done to handle large volumes of data and to improve performance. **sharding is a part of horizontal scaling**. It’s one of the techniques used to implement horizontal scaling effectively, especially for databases. 
- **Use Case**: Sharding is used when a database grows too large and needs to be split across multiple servers to improve scalability and performance.

**How It Works**:

- Data is divided based on certain criteria (e.g., by user ID, region, etc.), and each shard handles a specific subset of the data. The application needs to know where to look for the data, often using a **router** or **load balancer**.

**Pros of Sharding**:

- **Scalability**: You can scale horizontally by adding more shards (or servers) as your data grows.
- **Improved performance**: By splitting the data across multiple servers, each server handles a smaller load, so queries and writes can be processed faster.
- **High availability**: If one shard goes down, the other shards can continue to operate, preventing complete failure.

**Cons of Sharding**:

- **Complexity**: Sharding adds complexity to the system because the application must know how to split and route data to the correct shard.
- **Data consistency**: Ensuring consistency across multiple shards can be difficult. Each shard may not have the latest data from other shards.
- **Balancing load**: If data isn't evenly distributed, some shards might become overloaded while others remain underutilized.
- **Cross-shard queries**: Queries that need to combine data from multiple shards can be slow and inefficient.

#### Replication

- **Definition**: Replication refers to the process of copying and maintaining database objects, such as tables, across multiple database instances or servers.
  **Replication** is also a technique or a mechanism that contribute to horizontal scaling.
- **Use Case**: Replication is typically used to:
    - Improve read scalability by distributing read queries to multiple replicas.
    - Provide data redundancy for **high availability**.
    - Enable backup and failover strategies.
- **Limitations**: Replication doesn't inherently increase the write capacity of the system; it only helps with distributing read traffic.
##### Replication Models:

1. **Master-Slave (Primary-Replica) Replication**

- **Description**: In this model, one server (the **master**) is responsible for handling all write operations (insert, update, delete), while one or more **slaves** (also called **replicas**) replicate the data from the master and only handle read operations.
- **Key Points**:
    - **Master**: Handles all write operations and is the source of truth.
    - **Slaves**: Replicate the master's data and handle read queries.
    - **Asynchronous**: Slaves might lag behind the master in terms of updates, meaning there could be a slight delay in replication.
- **Use Case**: Commonly used in read-heavy applications where the goal is to offload read traffic from the master and improve performance.
- **Example**: MySQL Master-Slave, PostgreSQL Primary-Replica.


2. **Master-Master (Multi-Master) Replication**

- **Description**: In this model, multiple servers act as **masters**, each capable of handling both read and write operations. Data is synchronized between the masters, so each server can write to its own database and replicate changes to the other servers.
- **Key Points**:
    - Each master is both a **source of truth** and can perform **read/write operations**.
    - Conflicts may occur if two masters modify the same data simultaneously. These conflicts need to be resolved, which adds complexity to the system.
    - **Synchronous or Asynchronous** replication.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for applications where you need high availability and fault tolerance, and you want multiple locations to handle writes.
- **Example**: MySQL Master-Master replication, PostgreSQL with Bi-Directional Replication (BDR).

3. **Peer-to-Peer Replication**

- **Description**: This model is similar to **Master-Master** replication, but all nodes in the system are considered **peers**. There is no single master, and each node can handle both read and write operations. Data is replicated between all nodes, and changes are synchronized.
- **Key Points**:
    - **All nodes are equal** and can handle both reads and writes.
    - Often used in distributed systems where multiple nodes are used to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
    - **Conflict resolution** is required, as multiple nodes may write to the same data.
- **Use Case**: Common in distributed databases or systems with multiple geographic locations where each location can handle writes.
- **Example**: PostgreSQL with **Citus** (distributed PostgreSQL) or **CouchDB**.

4. **Synchronous Replication**

- **Description**: In this model, write operations on the master are not considered complete until the changes are replicated to the replicas. This ensures strong consistency but can introduce higher latency because write operations have to be confirmed by all replicas before being committed.
- **Key Points**:
    - Guarantees data consistency between the master and replicas.
    - Write operations are slower due to the need to confirm replication to all replicas.
    - Often used when **data consistency** is critical, such as in financial or transactional applications.
- **Use Case**: Systems that require strong consistency and can't tolerate data loss, such as in financial services or mission-critical applications.
- **Example**: PostgreSQL's synchronous replication, MySQL with semi-synchronous replication.

5. **Asynchronous Replication**

- **Description**: In this model, the master server commits a write operation without waiting for confirmation from the replicas. The data is eventually replicated to the slaves, but there may be a delay between when the write occurs on the master and when it is reflected on the replicas.
- **Key Points**:
    - Writes are faster because the master does not wait for replicas to confirm.
    - **Eventual consistency**: There can be a lag between the master and replicas, and the data may be out of sync for a short period.
    - Suitable for applications where performance is more important than immediate consistency.
- **Use Case**: Used in applications where high availability and performance are more important than strict consistency, such as content delivery networks (CDNs) or analytics systems.
- **Example**: MySQL Master-Slave, MongoDB replication.

6. **Cascading Replication**

- **Description**: This is a form of replication where one replica (slave) can itself act as a master to another replica. In other words, a chain of replicas is created, where a slave of the master becomes a master for other slaves.
- **Key Points**:
    - Helps in scaling read operations even further by creating a hierarchy of replicas.
    - Useful for geographically distributed systems where data needs to be replicated across regions.
    - Each level in the chain is still dependent on the top-most master.
- **Use Case**: Often used in large-scale systems or multi-region applications to offload traffic from the main master.
- **Example**: MySQL, PostgreSQL with cascading replication.

7. **Log Shipping**

- **Description**: Log shipping is the process of automatically sending transaction logs from the primary database server to one or more secondary servers. The secondary servers apply these logs to keep their data synchronized.
- **Key Points**:
    - Primarily used for **disaster recovery** and **standby databases**.
    - Can be asynchronous (logs are shipped periodically) or near real-time.
    - Secondary databases are typically read-only until the primary fails over.
- **Use Case**: Used for backup purposes or in disaster recovery scenarios where you want to maintain a near-identical copy of the database in case the primary server goes down.
- **Example**: PostgreSQL with continuous archiving.


#### Load Balancer

- **Definition**: A load balancer is a tool or service that distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers (or nodes) to ensure no single server is overwhelmed. It improves **availability**, **scalability**, and **fault tolerance**. It acts as a mechanism to distribute traffic across scaled and replicated systems.
- **Example**: If you have three web servers and a load balancer in front of them, the load balancer ensures each server gets an equal share of requests.
- **Types of Load Balancers**:
    1. **Hardware Load Balancers**: Dedicated physical devices.
    2. **Software Load Balancers**: Solutions like **HAProxy**, **Nginx**, or **AWS Elastic Load Balancer**.
- **Load Balancing Algorithms**:
    1. **Round Robin**: Each server gets a request in a circular order.
    2. **Least Connections**: Requests are sent to the server with the fewest active connections.
    3. **IP Hash**: Requests are distributed based on the hash of the client’s IP address.
- **Benefits**:
    1. Prevents overload on any single server.
    2. Improves fault tolerance: if one server fails, the load balancer redirects traffic to healthy servers.
    3. It is also a technique or a mechanism that contributes to **horizontal scaling**.

### Access Control

```sql
-- create user in mysql
CREATE USER 'Islam'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
-- `'Islam'`: The username being created.
-- `'%'`: This allows the user to connect from any host. If you want to restrict it to specific hosts, use `'Islam'@'127.0.0.1'` for local connections only.
-- `'password'`: The password for the user.


-- Syntax to grant privileges to users
GRANT [ALL, SELECT, CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER ..]
ON `database`.`table` TO 'username'@'host';

-- Grant All Privileges
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'Islam'@'%';

-- Grant Specific Privileges
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON `database_name`.* TO 'Islam'@'%';

-- Syntax for Removing Specific Privileges
REVOKE privilege_list ON `database_name`.`table_name` FROM 'username'@'host';

-- You previously granted `SELECT` and `INSERT` on a database `test_db` to the user `Islam`, so let's revoke the some privileges
REVOKE SELECT ON test_db.* FROM 'Islam'@'%';
REVOKE SELECT, INSERT ON test_db.* FROM 'Islam'@'%';

-- Revoke All Privileges
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES, GRANT OPTION FROM 'username'@'host';
-- **`ALL PRIVILEGES`**: Revokes all previously granted privileges.
-- **`GRANT OPTION`**: Removes the ability for the user to grant privileges to others.

-- To confirm the privileges of a user
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'Islam'@'%';

-- Always use `FLUSH PRIVILEGES` after modifying privileges to ensure changes are applied:
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


-- connect using this user
mysql -u Islam -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -p -- prompt me to enter the password

-- list all users
SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;

-- drop user
DROP USER 'Islam'@'%';
```

### SQL Injection Attacks

SQL Injection is a code injection technique where malicious users manipulate SQL queries by inserting harmful inputs into your application's input fields. This can allow attackers to:

- Access unauthorized data.
- Bypass authentication.
- Delete or modify data.
- Execute administrative operations.

##### How it Happens
Consider the following query in PHP:
```php
$username = $_POST['username'];
$password = $_POST['password'];

$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username' AND password = '$password'";

# If the user inputs the following:

# `username`: `' OR '1'='1`
# `password`: `'' OR UNION SELECT * FROM sensitive_table;`

# The resulting SQL query becomes:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1' AND password = '' OR UNION SELECT * FROM sensitive_table;;
# The condition `'1'='1'` is always true, allowing the attacker to bypass authentication.
```

---

### Prepared Statements
Prepared statements separate SQL code from user input, preventing user input from altering the SQL structure. Placeholders are used for inputs, which are bound securely.

#### Syntax

In prepared statements, you write the SQL query with placeholders and bind the input values before execution.
```sql
PREPARE statement_name FROM 'SQL query with placeholders';
SET @var1 = value1, @var2 = value2;
EXECUTE statement_name USING @var1, @var2;
DEALLOCATE PREPARE statement_name;

-- Example
-- 1. **Prepare the Statement:** Write the SQL query with placeholders (`?` for parameters).
PREPARE statement_name FROM 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ? AND password = ?';
-- 2. **Set the Variables:** Assign values to placeholders using variables.
SET @var1 = 123, @var2 = 'secure_password';
-- 3. **Execute the Statement:** Execute the prepared statement with the variables.
EXECUTE statement_name USING @var1, @var2;
-- 4. **Deallocate the Statement:** Clean up the prepared statement.
DEALLOCATE PREPARE statement_name;


-- User inputs (`@var1`, `@var2`) are **escaped automatically**, preventing SQL execution.
-- Even complex inputs like
SET @password = "' OR 1=1; DROP TABLE users; --";
-- will not harm the database because it’s treated as a string, not SQL code.


-- Example
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    username VARCHAR(50),
    password VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES 
('admin', 'admin123'),
('user', 'user123');

-- 1. Prepare the statement
PREPARE stmt FROM 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ? AND password = ?';

-- 2. Set the variables
SET @id = 1, @password = 'admin123';

-- 3. Execute the prepared statement
EXECUTE stmt USING @id, @password;

-- 4. Deallocate the statement
DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
```

PHP with Prepared Statements (MySQLi):
```php
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("ss", $username, $password); // "ss" indicates two string parameters
$stmt->execute();
$result = $stmt->get_result();
# The `?` placeholders are used for inputs.
# `bind_param` securely binds user inputs.
```

#### Escaping vs Preparing

##### Escaping
Escaping ensures that special characters in user input are treated as literal text, not as part of the SQL query. This is done by adding a backslash (`\`) or other escape sequences before special characters like quotes (`'` or `"`).

**How It Works**

Escaping modifies the user input before including it in the SQL query. For example:
```sql
-- Input: O'Reilly
-- to
-- Output: O\'Reilly
```

```php
$username = $mysqli->real_escape_string($_POST['username']);
$query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$username'";

# Input: username = ' OR '1'='1
# Escaped query:
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '\' OR \'1\'=\'1';
# Escaping prevents the query from executing improperly but is less reliable for complex cases.
```

##### Preparing
Preparing involves separating SQL logic (the query structure) from data (user input) by using placeholders for the inputs. The database engine treats placeholders (`?` or named variables) as **data only**, not as SQL code.

**How It Works**

1. **Prepare the Query**: Define the SQL structure with placeholders.
2. **Bind Input Values**: Assign values to placeholders securely.
3. **Execute the Query**: The database engine ensures the values cannot alter the SQL structure.
```php
$stmt = $mysqli->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?");
$stmt->bind_param("ss", $username, $password);
$stmt->execute();
```

```sql
-- Input:
	-- username = ' OR '1'='1
	-- password = anything
-- Prepared query:
	SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?;
	-- Values bound securely: 
	-- username = "' OR '1'='1"
	-- password = "anything"
-- The database engine ensures these inputs are treated as **data**, not SQL.
```


######  What Does "Inputs Are Treated as Data, Not SQL" Mean?

When you use **prepared statements**, the database engine separates the **SQL logic** (the structure of the query) from the **user-provided inputs** (the actual data). Here's how it works:

1. **SQL Logic**: The prepared statement defines the query structure with placeholders (`?` or named variables like `:param`), which act as "gaps" where user input will go.
    
Example SQL logic:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?;
```
    
2. **User Inputs (Data)**: When the query is executed, the actual values provided by the user (e.g., `'admin'`, `'password123'`) are securely "bound" to the placeholders.
    
3. **Treated as Data**: The database engine **guarantees** that the user inputs are treated only as values (data), not as part of the SQL query itself. This means inputs cannot change the query's structure.

###### Why Strings Can't Be Executed as SQL in Prepared Statements

Even if a user tries to inject SQL into a prepared statement, their input is handled as a **literal value**  "قيمة حرفية". For example:

**User Input (Malicious):**
```sql
username = "' OR 1=1; DROP TABLE users; --"
```

**Prepared Statement Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?;
```

The malicious input is bound as a literal string:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = "' OR 1=1; DROP TABLE users; --" AND password = 'anything';
```

Here:

- The input is treated as a string value (`'...'`).
- It cannot break out of its "string context" to execute any SQL logic like `DROP TABLE users;`.

**Result**: The query is safe, and the malicious SQL injection fails.

#### Notes

1. Always use prepared statements where possible. They are safer, more reliable, and replace the need for escaping.
2. Validate and sanitize user inputs.
3. **Prepared Statements** inherently prevent SQL injection because:
	- The query and inputs are processed separately.
	- Inputs are always treated as data, no matter what they contain.
	- **String Behavior**: Strings in prepared statements can't "escape" their context to become executable SQL.
1. Minimize permissions for database users (e.g., restrict write/delete rights).
2. Use modern libraries and ORM tools that handle input sanitization automatically.
