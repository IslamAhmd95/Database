### what is the superkey ?
One or more attributes that can **uniquely** identify a row "tuple" of data

### Simple SuperKey
A superkey that consists of a **single attribute**.

**Example:** In a table `Students` with attributes `(student_id, name, email)`, the attribute `student_id` alone can uniquely identify each student. Therefore, `{student_id}` is a simple superkey.


### Composite SuperKey
A superkey that consists of **multiple attributes**.

**Example:** In the same `Students` table, `{name, email}` can uniquely identify each student (assuming no two students have the same name and email). This is a composite superkey because it combines more than one attribute.


### Minimal Superkey (Candidate Key)
A superkey with **no redundant attributes**, removing any attribute from it would make it no longer a superkey.
It can be simple or composite.
Identifying the candidate keys is important to select the primary key.

**Example:**

1. `{student_id}` is a minimal superkey because it's enough on its own to uniquely identify each record.
2. `{name, email}` is also a minimal superkey if both are required to uniquely identify records.

### Primary Key (PK)
1. one of the candidate keys
2. unique
3. not null
4. stable "Should not change"
5. can be simple or composite

### Alternate Key
Any candidate key that is not chosen as PK

### Natural Key
A key that is derived from the actual data in the table, it has **business meaning** and already exists in the real world.

**Example:** 
- The **email** of a student (e.g., `john.doe@email.com`).
- A national ID number (e.g., `123456789`).

**Advantages:**
- Avoids creating additional columns, as the key is already part of the data.
- Can be easily understood by users since it has business relevance.

**Disadvantages:**
- May change over time (e.g., people change email addresses).
- Can become large or complex, making indexing and querying slower.
- Might expose sensitive or identifiable data (e.g., national ID numbers).


### Surrogate Key
An artificial or system-generated key that has no business meaning, it is typically an **integer** or **UUID** (Universally Unique Identifier).

**Example:**
- An auto-incrementing `user_id` column (e.g., `1, 2, 3...`) in a `Users` table.
- A UUID like `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`.

**Advantages:**
- Never changes, ensuring consistency over time.
- Simple and efficient for indexing and querying.
- Keeps business data hidden and secure.

**Disadvantages:**
- Adds an extra column that has no real-world meaning.
- May require joins or additional queries to retrieve meaningful data.


### Foreign Key (FK)
A column (or set of columns) in a table that establishes a **relationship** between two tables by referencing the **primary key** of another table, it enforces **referential integrity** by ensuring that relationships between tables remain consistent.

**How It Works:**
1. The **referencing table** contains the foreign key.
2. The **referenced table** contains the primary key that the foreign key refers to.
3. Every value in the foreign key column must match a value in the referenced primary key column or be `NULL`.

**Example:**

1. **Departments** (Referenced Table):

```sql

	CREATE TABLE Departments ( department_id INT PRIMARY KEY, department_name VARCHAR(100) );
	
```
    
2. **Employees** (Referencing Table):
    
```sql

CREATE TABLE Employees (     employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     name VARCHAR(100),     department_id INT,     FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES Departments(department_id) );
    
```

**Advantages:**

1. **Data Consistency:** Prevents invalid data by ensuring that the foreign key must match a primary key in the referenced table.
2. **Relational Integrity:** Helps maintain the logical connection between related data in different tables.
3. **Cascading Operations:** Automatically updates or deletes related data using **ON DELETE CASCADE** or **ON UPDATE CASCADE** rules.

**Cascading Options:**

When defining a foreign key, you can specify how changes to the referenced data affect the referencing table:

1. **ON DELETE CASCADE:** Deletes rows in the referencing table when the referenced row is deleted.
    - Example: Deleting a department removes all employees in that department.
2. **ON UPDATE CASCADE:** Updates foreign key values in the referencing table when the primary key in the referenced table changes.
3. **ON DELETE SET NULL:** Sets the foreign key to `NULL` if the referenced row is deleted.
4. **ON DELETE RESTRICT:** Prevents deletion of the referenced row if it is used in the referencing table.

**Notes:**

1. **Null Values:** Foreign keys can accept `NULL` values if the relationship is optional.
2. **Composite Foreign Keys:** A foreign key can consist of multiple columns.
3. **Indexing:** Foreign keys are typically indexed for performance during lookups and joins.
