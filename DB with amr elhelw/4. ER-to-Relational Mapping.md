### Building the ER Diagram for the social media app

### Mapping from ER Diagram to the relational model

#### Step 1 "Entities"

- Each entity type becomes a table
- Attributes become columns in the table
- Choose Primary key
	1. Simple or Composite
	2. Unique
	3. Not null
	4. Minimal

#### Step 2 "Relationships"

1. (1:1)
   ![[Pasted image 20241203080444.png]]

	**Examples:**
	1. (Total : Total)

		- Entities (S:T)
		  - S = Person `{id, name}`
		  - T = Passport `{Number, expiry date}`
		- Relationship : `{Person}` owns `{password}`
		- Total participation: Every `Person` must have a `Passport`, and every `Passport` must belong to a `Person`.
		- Result: Merge into one table:  `Person(ID, Name, PassportNumber, ExpiryDate)`


	2. (Partial : Total)
	   
		- Entities (S:T)
		    - S = Person `{id, name}`
		    - T = ParkingSpot `{SpotID, Location`}
		- Relationship : `{Person}` is assigned to `{ParkingSpot}`
		- Partial participation: Not every `Person` gets a `ParkingSpot`.
		- Total participation: Every `ParkingSpot` must belong to a `Person`
		- Result: Add a foreign key `PersonID` to T:  `ParkingSpot(SpotID, Location, PersonID)`
		
		  
    3. (Partial : Partial)
	       - Entities
		       - S= `Professor(ProfID, Name)`
		       - T= `Office(RoomID, Location)`
		- Relationship: `Professor` _is assigned to_ `Office`.
		- Partial Participation:
		    - Not all `Professors` are assigned an `Office`.
		    - Not all `Offices` are assigned to a `Professor`.
		- Implementation Options:
			1. **Foreign Key in T (Office Table)**:
			    
			    - Add `ProfID` as a foreign key to the `Office` table.
			    - Resulting table structure:
			        - `Office(RoomID, Location, ProfID)`
			    - If a professor doesn’t have an office, the `ProfID` field can remain NULL.
			2. **Foreign Key in S (Professor Table)**:
			    
			    - Add `RoomID` as a foreign key to the `Professor` table.
			    - Resulting table structure:
			        - `Professor(ProfID, Name, RoomID)`
			    - If a professor doesn’t have an office, the `RoomID` field can remain NULL.
			3. **Separate Relationship Table**:
			    
			    - Create a new table to represent the relationship, containing only participating entities:
			        - `ProfessorOffice(ProfID, RoomID, RelationshipAttributes)`
			    - This approach is useful if the relationship has additional attributes, like the date the professor was assigned to the office.
			

2. (1:N)
   
   - S: "N" side, T: "1" side
   - Add FK to S that refers to PK of T
   - Relationship attribute should added to S
	 **Example:**
     ` the user_id FK in posts table that refers to the user_id PK in the users table , and you can add any relationship attributes to the posts table like PostDate. Visibility` 
     
3. (M:N)
	- Participating tables: S, T
	- Create a new table R to represent the relationship
	- Add all the relationship attributes (if any) to R 
	- add FKs to R that refers to both S, T
	- PK or R is the combination of all the FKs (+ additional columns if needed)
		**Examples**:
		1. `Follows(follower_id, followed_id, followDate)`
			- `follower_id` and `followed_id` are FKs referring to `Users(user_id)`.
			- PK: `(follower_id, followed_id)`.
			- `followDate` is an additional attribute.
		2.  `Likes(user_id, post_id, likeDate)`

			- `user_id` FK refers to `Users(user_id)`.
			- `post_id` FK refers to `Posts(post_id)`.
			- PK: `(user_id, post_id)`.
			- `likeDate` is an additional attribute.
		3. `Comments(comment_id, user_id, post_id, commentText, commentDate)`

			- `comment_id` is a unique identifier for the comment (PK).
			- `user_id` FK refers to `Users(user_id)`.
			- `post_id` FK refers to `Posts(post_id)`.
			- Additional attributes: `commentText`, `commentDate` 




### Final Result
