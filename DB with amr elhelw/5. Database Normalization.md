### Normalization
Normalization is a process in database design used to organize data into tables to minimize redundancy and eliminate undesirable anomalies such as insertion, update, and deletion issues.

 **Advantages:**
- Reduces data redundancy.
- Ensures data consistency.
- Improves data integrity.
- Simplifies maintenance and updates.

 **Example:**
	Imagine a table with multiple entries for the same `customer_id` but with different `birth_date` values:

| customer_id | Dbirth     |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| 1           | 1990-12-01 |
| 1           | 1999-11-21 |
	This inconsistency can lead to confusion and errors when querying or updating records. Normalization resolves such issues by separating data into related tables.

	
#### Normal Forms
Normal forms are a set of guidelines for database structure to ensure data is stored efficiently. Each normal form addresses specific types of redundancy or anomalies:

- **Purpose**: To achieve better organization of data and prevent anomalies such as insertion, update, and deletion issues.
- **Use**: Breaks data into smaller, more manageable tables while preserving relationships.

##### First Normal Form (1NF)

1. **No multi-valued attributes**:  
   Each cell in a table must contain a single value (atomic data).  
   **Example:** 
    
   **Bad:**  
   
   | OrderID | ProductNames       |
   |---------|--------------------|
   | 1       | Phone, Charger     |  
   
   **Fixed:**  
   
   | OrderID | ProductName        |
   |---------|--------------------|
   | 1       | Phone              |
   | 1       | Charger            |

2. **Can't use row order to convey information**:  
   The order of rows should not have any meaning. Use a column for ordering instead.  
   **Example:**  
   
   **Bad:** The 3rd row represents the most recent order.  
   
   **Fixed:** Add a column for the date:  
   
   | OrderID | OrderDate          |
   |---------|--------------------|
   | 1       | 2024-01-01         |

3. **Always define a PK**:  
   Every table must have a primary key to uniquely identify each row.  
   **Example:**  
   
   **Bad:**  
   
   | Name    | Email              |
   |---------|--------------------|
   | Alice   | alice@email.com    |  
   
   **Fixed:** Add a `UserID`:  
   
   | UserID  | Name     | Email              |
   |---------|----------|--------------------|
   | 1       | Alice    | alice@email.com    |

4. **No mixing data types within a column**:  
   Each column must store only one type of data.  
   **Example:**  
   
   **Bad:**  
   
   | ProductID | Price            |
   |-----------|------------------|
   | 1         | 20.5             |
   | 2         | Free             |  
   
   **Fixed:** Use consistent data types:  
   
   | ProductID | Price            |
   |-----------|------------------|
   | 1         | 20.5             |
   | 2         | 0.0              |

5. **No multiple columns with the same name**:  
   Avoid duplicate column names to store related data.  
   **Example:**
     
   **Bad:**  
   
   | ProductID | Color1 | Color2  |
   |-----------|--------|---------|
   | 1         | Red    | Blue    |  
   
   **Fixed:** Create a separate table:  
   
   | ProductID | Color            |
   |-----------|------------------|
   | 1         | Red              |
   | 1         | Blue             |

##### Second Normal Form (2NF)

1. **Must satisfy 1NF**:  
   The table must first meet all requirements of the First Normal Form (1NF).

2. **Each non-key attribute must depend on the entire primary key**:  
   Non-key attributes must have a functional dependency on the whole composite primary key (if the table has one), not just part of it.  
   This helps avoid the following anomalies:  
   - **Deletion anomaly**: Deleting one piece of information also deletes unrelated data.  
   - **Update anomaly**: Changing data in one row requires updating multiple rows to avoid inconsistency.  
   - **Insertion anomaly**: Adding data is impossible without including unrelated or incomplete information.  

 **Example:**

**Bad Table:** (Before 2NF)  

| StudentID | CourseID | CourseName  | InstructorName |     |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- | -------------- | --- |
| 1         | C101     | Mathematics | Dr. Smith      |     |
| 2         | C101     | Mathematics | Dr. Smith      |     |

- **Primary Key:** `(StudentID, CourseID)`  
- Issue: `CourseName` and `InstructorName` depend only on `CourseID`, not the whole primary key `(StudentID, CourseID)`.

**Problems with this table:**
1. **Deletion anomaly**: If all students drop `C101`, the course details (`CourseName`, `InstructorName`) are lost.
2. **Update anomaly**: If the course instructor changes, we need to update multiple rows for all students taking `C101`.
3. **Insertion anomaly**: Adding a new course without a student taking it is impossible.

**Fixed Table:** (After 2NF)  
1. **Courses Table:**  
   
   | CourseID | CourseName   | InstructorName   |
   |----------|--------------|------------------|
   | C101     | Mathematics  | Dr. Smith        |

2. **Enrollments Table:**  
   
   | StudentID | CourseID    |
   |-----------|-------------|
   | 1         | C101        |
   | 2         | C101        |

- Now, all non-key attributes depend on their respective primary keys. 
- Anomalies are resolved: Course details are stored separately in the `Courses` table, independent of student enrollments.

--- 

##### Third Normal Form (3NF)

1. **Must satisfy 2NF**:  
   The table must first meet all requirements of the Second Normal Form (2NF).

2. **No non-key attribute is dependent on another non-key attribute**:  
   All non-key attributes must depend only on the primary key, not on other non-key attributes.  
   This eliminates **transitive dependency**.

 **What is Transitive Dependency?**
A transitive dependency occurs when a non-key attribute depends on another non-key attribute rather than directly on the primary key.  
- **Example of Transitive Dependency**:  
   - In a table with `StudentID`, `DepartmentID`, and `DepartmentName`:  
     `DepartmentName` depends on `DepartmentID`, and `DepartmentID` depends on `StudentID`.  
     Hence, `DepartmentName` has a transitive dependency on `StudentID`.

 **Examples:**
 
**Bad Table:** (Before 3NF)  

| StudentID | DepartmentID | DepartmentName |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| 1         | D01          | Computer Science |
| 2         | D02          | Mathematics      |

- **Primary Key:** `StudentID`
- **Issue:**  
   - `DepartmentName` depends on `DepartmentID`, not directly on the primary key `StudentID`.  
   - This creates a transitive dependency.

**Problems with this table:**
1. **Deletion anomaly**: If all students leave a department, its name is lost.
2. **Update anomaly**: Changing the name of a department requires updating multiple rows.
3. **Insertion anomaly**: Adding a new department without students is impossible.

**Fixed Table:** (After 3NF)  

1. **Students Table:**  
   | StudentID | DepartmentID |
   |-----------|--------------|
   | 1         | D01          |
   | 2         | D02          |

2. **Departments Table:**  
   | DepartmentID | DepartmentName      |
   |--------------|---------------------|
   | D01          | Computer Science    |
   | D02          | Mathematics         |

- Now, `DepartmentName` is stored in a separate table and depends only on `DepartmentID`.  
- Transitive dependency is removed, and anomalies are resolved.

**Summary of 3NF**:
- Ensures no transitive dependency between attributes.  
- Non-key attributes must depend only on the primary key.
- Organizes data more efficiently by separating dependent data into related tables.

##### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

1. **Upgraded version of 3NF (also called "3.5 NF")**:  
   BCNF is a stricter version of 3NF.

2. **Must satisfy 2NF**:  
   The table must first meet all requirements of the Second Normal Form (2NF).

3. **No attribute at all is dependent on a non-key attribute**:  
   This ensures that every determinant (an attribute that determines another) is a candidate key.

 **Examples:**
 
**Bad Table:** (Before BCNF)  

| StudentID | CourseID | InstructorName |
|-----------|----------|----------------|
| 1         | C101     | Dr. Smith      |
| 2         | C102     | Dr. Jones      |
| 3         | C101     | Dr. Smith      |

- **Candidate Keys:** `(StudentID, CourseID)`  
- **Issue:** `InstructorName` depends only on `CourseID`, which is a non-key attribute.

**Problems with this table:**
1. **Update anomaly**: If an instructor changes for a course, we need to update multiple rows.
2. **Deletion anomaly**: If all students drop a course, information about the instructor is lost.
3. **Insertion anomaly**: We cannot add a new course with its instructor until a student enrolls.

**Fixed Table:** (After BCNF)  

1. **Enrollments Table:**  
   | StudentID | CourseID |
   |-----------|----------|
   | 1         | C101     |
   | 2         | C102     |
   | 3         | C101     |

2. **Courses Table:**  
   | CourseID | InstructorName |
   |----------|----------------|
   | C101     | Dr. Smith      |
   | C102     | Dr. Jones      |

- Now, `InstructorName` depends only on `CourseID`, which is a candidate key in the `Courses` table.  
- Anomalies are resolved.

 **Summary of BCNF:**
- Ensures no dependency on non-key attributes, even if the table satisfies 3NF.  
- Further eliminates redundancy and improves data integrity.

---

##### **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**

1. **Definition:**
   - A table is in 4NF if it satisfies **BCNF** and contains **no non-trivial multi-valued dependencies (MVDs)**.  
   - In other words, each attribute in the table must depend solely on the primary key and not on multiple independent attributes.

2. **Why 4NF?**
   - To eliminate redundancy caused by **Multi-Valued Dependencies (MVDs)**.  
   - To avoid data anomalies (insertion, update, deletion) while handling attributes that can have multiple independent values.

 **Multi-Valued Dependency (MVD):**
- An MVD \( X↠Y \) exists when:
  - A value in column \( X \) determines multiple independent values in column \( Y \), regardless of other attributes.
  - These independent values do not depend on each other.

 **Trivial vs. Non-Trivial MVDs:**
1. **Trivial MVD:**
   - \( X↠Y \) is trivial if \( Y ⊆ X \).  
   - Example: \( StudentID ↠ StudentID \).  

2. **Non-Trivial MVD:**
   - \( X↠Y \) is non-trivial if \( Y not ⊆ X ).  
   - Example: \( StudentID ↠ Course \), \( StudentID ↠ Hobby \).

 **Example:**

| **StudentID** | **Course**   | **Hobby**        |
|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| 1             | Math         | Chess            |
| 1             | Physics      | Chess            |
| 1             | Math         | Reading          |
| 1             | Physics      | Reading          |

1. **MVDs Present:**
   - \( StudentID ↠ Course \): A student can enroll in multiple courses.  
   - \( StudentID ↠ Hobby \): A student can have multiple hobbies.  
   - No relationship exists between **Course** and **Hobby**.

2. **Problems with this Design:**
   - **Redundancy:** Chess and Reading are repeated for each course.  
   - **Space Wastage:** Storing duplicated data for no logical reason.  
   - **Anomalies:**
     - **Update Anomaly:** Changing a student's hobby requires updating multiple rows.  
     - **Deletion Anomaly:** Deleting a course might also remove hobby information.  

3. **Solution: Apply 4NF**
   - Separate the data into two tables to eliminate the non-trivial MVDs.

 **After Normalization (4NF):**
1. **Student-Course Table:**

   | **StudentID** | **Course**   |
   |---------------|--------------|
   | 1             | Math         |
   | 1             | Physics      |

2. **Student-Hobby Table:**

   | **StudentID** | **Hobby**    |
   |---------------|--------------|
   | 1             | Chess        |
   | 1             | Reading      |

---

 **Why Normalizing Helps with Space and Redundancy?**
1. **Space Optimization:**
   - Although we split data into multiple tables, each table is smaller and avoids duplication. 
   - For large datasets, avoiding redundancy results in significant space savings.

2. **Redundancy Reduction:**
   - By eliminating duplication, we ensure each piece of information is stored only once.

3. **Data Integrity:**
   - Normalization prevents inconsistencies by ensuring that each piece of data is updated in only one place.

 **Key Takeaways:**
- 4NF focuses on removing redundancy caused by non-trivial multi-valued dependencies.  
- Trivial dependencies (e.g., \( StudentID ↠ StudentID \)) are harmless and do not cause anomalies.  
- Splitting tables improves data consistency, reduces redundancy, and optimizes space for long-term use.

### Fifth Normal Form (5NF)

 **Definition:**
- A table is in **5NF** if it satisfies **4NF** and cannot be further decomposed into smaller tables without introducing **join-dependencies**.
- **Join-dependency**: This occurs when a table can be split into two or more tables and later joined back without losing any data or information.
- The goal of 5NF is to eliminate all possible redundancies caused by multi-way relationships between attributes.
  
**Example:**
Initially, there was one large table combining **Customer**, **Brand**, and **Flavor**:

| **Customer** | **Brand** | **Flavor**   |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| Anna         | P2        | Chicken      |
| Anna         | P2        | Mushroom     |
| Anna         | P3        | Chicken      |
| Anna         | P3        | Mushroom     |
| Tom          | P1        | Cheese       |
| Tom          | P1        | Veggie       |
| Tom          | P2        | Cheese       |
| Tom          | P2        | Chicken      |

This table is redundant because there is no direct dependency between **Brand** and **Flavor**.  
For example:
- Anna prefers **P2** and **P3** as brands.
- Anna likes **Chicken** and **Mushroom** as flavors.
- But there’s no inherent link between a specific brand and a specific flavor. 

 **Decomposition in 5NF:**
To remove redundancies, we decompose the table into **three smaller tables**:  

1. **Customer_Brand**: Tracks which brands each customer likes.  
   
| **Customer** | **Brand** |
|--------------|-----------|
| Anna         | P2        |
| Anna         | P3        |
| Tom          | P1        |
| Tom          | P2        |

2. **Customer_Flavor**: Tracks which flavors each customer likes.  
   
| **Customer** | **Flavor** |
|--------------|------------|
| Anna         | Chicken    |
| Anna         | Mushroom   |
| Tom          | Cheese     |
| Tom          | Veggie     |
| Tom          | Chicken    |

3. **Brand_Flavor**: Tracks which flavors are associated with each brand.  

| **Brand** | **Flavor**   |
|-----------|--------------|
| P1        | Cheese       |
| P1        | Veggie       |
| P1        | Mushroom     |
| P2        | Cheese       |
| P2        | Chicken      |
| P3        | Cheese       |
| P3        | Chicken      |
| P3        | Mushroom     |

 **Benefits of 5NF:**
- **Eliminates Redundancy**: Avoids storing duplicate information about relationships.  
- **Improves Data Integrity**: Prevents inconsistencies that arise when redundant data gets updated.  
- **Space Efficiency**: Though it seems like creating multiple tables uses more space, it actually reduces redundancy, ensuring less duplication of data.

 **Join Dependency Explained:**
- If we join the three decomposed tables (**Customer_Brand**, **Customer_Flavor**, and **Brand_Flavor**) back together, we can recreate the original table without losing any data.
- This ensures the decomposition is **lossless**.

In this example, there’s no direct dependency between **Brand** and **Flavor**, so decomposing into three tables ensures data consistency and eliminates redundancy.
