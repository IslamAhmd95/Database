### INNER JOIN

An `INNER JOIN` is used to combine rows from two tables based on a related column between them. It only includes rows where there is a match in both tables.

#### Key Points:
1. The `INNER JOIN` returns only the rows where the join condition is true.
2. The result set includes columns from both tables, which are combined when their values match.

#### Example:

**Tables Used:**
- **Customers Table:**
  Contains customer information with columns: `c_id`, `c_name`, and `city`.
  
- **Stores Table:**
  Contains store information with columns: `s_id`, `s_name`, and `city`.

**Task:**
Find customers and stores located in the same city.

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM customers c 
INNER JOIN stores s 
ON c.city = s.city;
```

**Explanation of the Query:**
- The `INNER JOIN` matches rows in the `customers` table (`c`) with rows in the `stores` table (`s`) where the `city` column in both tables is equal (`c.city = s.city`).

**Result:**
The output table will only include:
1. Customers and stores that are in the same city.
2. Columns from both tables (`c_id`, `c_name`, `city`, `s_id`, `s_name`, `city`).

#### Result:
From the tables:
- **Matching Rows:**
  - John (New York) matches with Store 1 (New York) and Store 3 (New York).
  - Alice (Chicago) matches with Store 2 (Chicago) and Store 5 (Chicago).
  - Tom (New York) matches with Store 1 (New York) and Store 3 (New York).

**Final Output Table:**

| c_id | c_name | city     | s_id | s_name   | city     |
|------|--------|----------|------|----------|----------|
| 1    | John   | New York | 101  | Store 1  | New York |
| 1    | John   | New York | 103  | Store 3  | New York |
| 3    | Alice  | Chicago  | 102  | Store 2  | Chicago  |
| 3    | Alice  | Chicago  | 105  | Store 5  | Chicago  |
| 4    | Tom    | New York | 101  | Store 1  | New York |
| 4    | Tom    | New York | 103  | Store 3  | New York |

#### Visual Representation:

![[Pasted image 20241208091336.png]]

Using a Venn diagram:
- The `INNER JOIN` represents the intersection between the two tables, including only matching rows.

#### Properties:
- `A INNER JOIN B` is equivalent to `B INNER JOIN A`.

### OUTER JOIN

An `OUTER JOIN` includes rows that do not have a match in one or both tables, depending on the type of join.

#### Key Points:
- **LEFT JOIN:** Includes all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. Rows from the left table without matches will have `NULL` for columns from the right table.
- **RIGHT JOIN:** Includes all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table. Rows from the right table without matches will have `NULL` for columns from the left table.
- **FULL JOIN:** Includes all rows from both tables. Rows without a match in either table will have `NULL` for the missing values.

#### Example:

**Tables Used:**
- **Customers Table**:
  Contains customer information with columns: `c_id`, `c_name`, and `city`.
  
- **Stores Table**:
  Contains store information with columns: `s_id`, `s_name`, and `city`.
  
#### 1. LEFT JOIN:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM customers c 
LEFT JOIN stores s 
ON c.city = s.city;
```

**Explanation:**
- Includes all rows from the `customers` table.
- Adds matching rows from the `stores` table where `c.city = s.city`.
- Rows in `customers` without a match will have `NULL` for store columns.

**Result:**

| c_id | c_name | city       | s_id  | s_name    | city       |
|------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|------------|
| 1    | John   | New York   | 101   | Store 1   | New York   |
| 1    | John   | New York   | 103   | Store 3   | New York   |
| 2    | Bob    | Los Angeles| NULL  | NULL      | NULL       |
| 3    | Alice  | Chicago    | 102   | Store 2   | Chicago    |
| 3    | Alice  | Chicago    | 105   | Store 5   | Chicago    |
| 4    | Tom    | New York   | 101   | Store 1   | New York   |
| 4    | Tom    | New York   | 103   | Store 3   | New York   |
| 5    | Emily  | Boston     | NULL  | NULL      | NULL       |

#### 2. RIGHT JOIN:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM customers c 
RIGHT JOIN stores s 
ON c.city = s.city;
```

**Explanation:**
- Includes all rows from the `stores` table.
- Adds matching rows from the `customers` table where `c.city = s.city`.
- Rows in `stores` without a match will have `NULL` for customer columns.

**Result:**

| c_id  | c_name | city       | s_id  | s_name    | city       |
|-------|--------|------------|-------|-----------|------------|
| 1     | John   | New York   | 101   | Store 1   | New York   |
| 4     | Tom    | New York   | 101   | Store 1   | New York   |
| 1     | John   | New York   | 103   | Store 3   | New York   |
| 4     | Tom    | New York   | 103   | Store 3   | New York   |
| 3     | Alice  | Chicago    | 102   | Store 2   | Chicago    |
| 3     | Alice  | Chicago    | 105   | Store 5   | Chicago    |
| NULL  | NULL   | NULL       | 104   | Store 4   | Miami      |

#### 3. FULL JOIN:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM customers c 
FULL JOIN stores s 
ON c.city = s.city;
```

**Explanation:**
- Includes all rows from both `customers` and `stores`.
- Rows without matches in either table will have `NULL` for the missing values.

**Result:**

| c_id | c_name | city        | s_id | s_name  | city     |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- | ---- | ------- | -------- |
| 1    | John   | New York    | 101  | Store 1 | New York |
| 1    | John   | New York    | 103  | Store 3 | New York |
| 4    | Tom    | New York    | 101  | Store 1 | New York |
| 4    | Tom    | New York    | 103  | Store 3 | New York |
| 3    | Alice  | Chicago     | 102  | Store 2 | Chicago  |
| 3    | Alice  | Chicago     | 105  | Store 5 | Chicago  |
| 2    | Bob    | Los Angeles | NULL | NULL    | NULL     |
| 5    | Emily  | Boston      | NULL | NULL    | NULL     |
| NULL | NULL   | NULL        | 104  | Store 4 | Miami    |

**Note:**

- In MySQL, **`FULL OUTER JOIN`** is not natively supported, which is why you might encounter errors when trying to use it. To achieve the same result as a `FULL OUTER JOIN`, you need to use the **`UNION`** approach
  
```sql

SELECT *
FROM orders
LEFT JOIN customers
ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id

UNION

SELECT *
FROM orders
RIGHT JOIN customers
ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;

  
```

### SEMI JOIN and ANTI JOIN Explanation

#### 1. SEMI JOIN
- A `SEMI JOIN` returns rows from one table **only if there is a match** in the other table.
- Unlike an `INNER JOIN`, it does not return columns from the second table, only filtering the rows in the first table.

##### Using the Example:
We want to find customers who are located in the same city as any store.

```sql
-- Using IN
SELECT * 
FROM customers c
WHERE c.city IN (SELECT s.city FROM stores s);

-- Using EXISTS
SELECT * 
FROM customers c
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM stores s WHERE c.city = s.city);
-- we dont need to use "*" or "s.city" because exists returns true/false 
```

**Explanation:**
- Both queries filter rows in the `customers` table based on whether the city (`c.city`) exists in the `stores` table.
- The `IN` query matches values directly, while the `EXISTS` query checks for existence via a subquery.

**Result:**

| c_id | c_name | city       |
|------|--------|------------|
| 1    | John   | New York   |
| 3    | Alice  | Chicago    |
| 4    | Tom    | New York   |

#### 2. ANTI JOIN
- An `ANTI JOIN` returns rows from one table **only if there is no match** in the other table.

##### Using the Example:
We want to find customers who are **not located** in the same city as any store.

```sql
-- Using NOT IN
SELECT * 
FROM customers c
WHERE c.city NOT IN (SELECT s.city FROM stores s);

-- Using NOT EXISTS
SELECT * 
FROM customers c
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM stores s WHERE c.city = s.city);
```

**Explanation:**
- Both queries filter rows in the `customers` table based on the absence of the city (`c.city`) in the `stores` table.
- The `NOT IN` query excludes matches directly, while the `NOT EXISTS` query excludes them via a subquery.

**Result:**

| c_id | c_name | city       |
|------|--------|------------|
| 2    | Bob    | Los Angeles|
| 5    | Emily  | Boston     |
