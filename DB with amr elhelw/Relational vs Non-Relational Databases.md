# This course is not Completed, let's focus on work now

## Relations (SQL) vs Non-Relational (No-SQL)

### Relational Database
	- structured
	- entities must have the same attributes
	- Schema (tables structure) must be pre-defined
	- use SQL (structured query language)




### Non-Relational Database
	- semi structured
	- entities may not have the same attributes
	- flexible schema
	- no specific language , depends on each system (I don't know how ?)

#### Types of Non-Relational Database
	- graph databases
	  (nodes - edges) (I need an example for it and more details)
	- key-value databases
		  it's like hash tables
