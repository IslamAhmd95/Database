### Cross Join

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM users, langs 
WHERE users.lang_id = langs.id;
```

This is a **CROSS JOIN with a filter **. It achieves the same result as an **INNER JOIN** but uses an older syntax that is less explicit about the join type.

When you list multiple tables separated by commas (`users, langs`), SQL performs a **CROSS JOIN**, meaning it pairs every row from `users` with every row from `langs`.

This effectively creates the behavior of an **INNER JOIN**.

Equivalent Using Modern JOIN Syntax:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM users 
INNER JOIN langs 
ON users.lang_id = langs.id;
```

#### Why using `on` and not using `where` ?

- **`ON` Clause**:
    - Specifies the condition for how rows from the two tables are matched.
    - This is part of the **join operation**.
- **`WHERE` Clause**:
    - Filters the resulting rows **after the join** is completed.
    - Used for conditions unrelated to the join logic.
      
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM users 
INNER JOIN langs 
ON users.lang_id = langs.id
WHERE users.active = 1;
```

### Aliases

```sql
SELECT 
    u.user_id AS USER_ID, 
    u.user_name AS USER_NAME, 
    l.id AS LANG_ID, 
    l.lang_name AS LANG_NAME 
FROM users u  %% it is like user as u, langs as l %%
INNER JOIN langs l 
ON u.lang_id = l.id 
WHERE u.active = 1;
```

**Aliases** are temporary names assigned to tables or columns to:

1. Simplify queries.
2. Improve readability.
3. Handle ambiguous column names when using joins.
4. Can be used for tables names or columns names
5. Convention: Use uppercase for alias names to distinguish them visually.
6. When two tables in a query have columns with the same name (e.g., `id`), aliases prevent ambiguity.
	
```sql
SELECT u.id AS USER_ID, l.id AS LANG_ID 
FROM users u 
INNER JOIN langs l 
ON u.lang_id = l.id;
```

7. Use the table alias, not the table name, once an alias is defined in `where` or `on` clauses.

### Inner Join

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM users U 
INNER JOIN langs L 
ON U.lang_id = L.id 
WHERE U.active = 1;
```

An **`INNER JOIN`** is a type of SQL join that retrieves records from two tables where there is a matching condition between them. If no match exists, the rows are excluded from the result set.

#### Key Points

- `Inner Join` combines rows from two tables based on a matching condition.
- The condition is defined in the `ON` clause.
- Only rows that satisfy the condition are included in the output.

### Left Join

A **`LEFT JOIN`** includes all rows from the left table (`users`), even if there is no match in the right table (`langs`). If there’s no match, `NULL` is returned for columns from the right table.

```sql
SELECT 
    L.lang_name AS LANGUAGE, 
    COUNT(U.user_id) AS USER_COUNT
FROM users U
LEFT JOIN langs L
ON U.lang_id = L.id
GROUP BY L.lang_name
ORDER BY USER_COUNT DESC;
```

---

### Right Join

A **`RIGHT JOIN`** includes all rows from the right table (`langs`), even if there is no match in the left table (`users`). If there’s no match, `NULL` is returned for columns from the left table.

```sql
SELECT 
    L.lang_name AS LANGUAGE, 
    COUNT(U.user_id) AS USER_COUNT
FROM users U
RIGHT JOIN langs L
ON U.lang_id = L.id
GROUP BY L.lang_name
ORDER BY USER_COUNT DESC;
```

---

### Full Outer Join

A **`FULL OUTER JOIN`** includes all rows from both tables. If there’s no match, `NULL` is returned for columns from the table without a match.

```sql
SELECT 
    COALESCE(U.user_name, 'No User') AS USER_NAME, 
    COALESCE(L.lang_name, 'No Language') AS LANGUAGE
FROM users U
FULL OUTER JOIN langs L
ON U.lang_id = L.id
ORDER BY USER_NAME;
```

---

### Using

The **`USING`** clause is used when the column names in both tables are **identical**. It simplifies the syntax by eliminating the need to explicitly qualify the column names with table aliases.

```sql
SELECT U.user_id, U.user_name, L.lang_name
FROM users U
JOIN langs L
USING (lang_id);
%% USING (lang_id = ON U.lang_id = L.lang_id %%
%% so the column "lang_id" is the same on both tables so i can use `using` without the table aliases "U, L" %%
%% `USING` automatically assumes equality between the specified column in both tables (`lang_id` in this case). %%
%% if the columns of the condition not identical, like users.lang_id , langs.id
so i have to use ON, ON U.lang_id = L.id %% 
```
