### Comparison Functions & Operators

```sql
select * from students where id between 2 and 10;
select * from admins where created_at between date_sub(curDate(), interval 2 year);
select * from payment where paid_at not between date_sub(curdate(), interval 1 year) and date_sub(curdate(), interval 2 month);
%% between Expr1 and Expr2 / not between Expr1 and Expr2%%
%% `Expr2` must be **greater than** or **newer than** `Expr1` when comparing numerical values or dates.  %%
%% BETWEEN includes the boundary values (`Expr1` and `Expr2`), column_name >= Expr1 AND column_name <= Expr2 %%
%% Not Between Excludes the boundary values, column_name < Expr1 OR column_name > Expr2 %%


select * from students where id in (1, 2, 3, 4)
select * from students where id not in (1, 2, 3, 4)
select * from countries where name not in ("Egypt", "Saudi Arabia");
select * from countries where name not in (curdate(), '2024-12-17');
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE client_id IN (SELECT id FROM clients WHERE country = 'USA');
%% 
- **`IN`**: To filter rows where a column matches any value in a specified list.
- **`NOT IN`**: To filter rows where a column does **not** match any value in a specified list.
- column_name IN (value1, value2, value3, ...) ,
column_name NOT IN (value1, value2, value3, ...)
- If the list contains a `NULL` value, `NOT IN` will return no rows because any comparisons (`=`, `<`, `<>`) with `NULL` always result in `UNKNOWN`, Example:
select * from countries where name not in ("egypt", "Saudi Arabia", NULL); will always be null
- **`NOT IN` Behavior**:
    - Requires **all comparisons** to be `TRUE`.
    - If any comparison evaluates to `FALSE` or `UNKNOWN` (e.g., due to `NULL`), the entire condition fails, and no rows are returned.
- **`IN` Behavior**:    
    - Requires **at least one comparison** to be `TRUE`.
    - It ignores `FALSE` and `UNKNOWN` results, as long as there is at least one `TRUE` result.
%%


SELECT * FROM table WHERE column LIKE '%tt%r%';  %% pattern %%
%% The `LIKE` operator is used to search for a specified pattern in a column. %%
SELECT * FROM table WHERE column not LIKE '%tt%r%';
%% The `NOT LIKE` operator is used to exclude rows that match a certain pattern. %%
%% 
**Wildcards**

Wildcards are special characters that allow you to create flexible patterns in the `LIKE` operator. There are two main wildcards in SQL:
- `%` (Percentage Sign): Represents **zero or more characters**
- `_` (Underscore): Represents **exactly one character**.


- The word "wildcards" in this context refers to characters used for **flexible pattern matching**. The term "wildcard" translates roughly to **"رموز بدل"** in Arabic, which means characters that substitute for any other characters in a pattern.

- **"Wildcard"**: In computing, a wildcard is a character that can stand for any other character(s) in a search pattern, which is why it is used in SQL `LIKE` patterns.

### Logical Operators

```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
%% 
AND
- Combines two or more conditions.
- Returns `TRUE` if **all conditions** are true.
%%


SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition1 OR condition2;
%% 
OR
- Combines two or more conditions.
- Returns `TRUE` if **any condition** is true.
%%


SELECT * FROM table WHERE NOT condition;
%% 
NOT
- Negates a condition.
- Returns `TRUE` if the condition is false.
%%


%% 
Notes:

1. **Order of Precedence**:  
    - `NOT` is evaluated first.
    - Then `AND`.
    - Finally, `OR`.
    - Use parentheses to control the order explicitly.
2. **NULL and UNKNOWN**:
    - Conditions involving `NULL` often result in `UNKNOWN`.
    - For example: `age > 18 OR age IS NULL` returns `TRUE` if either condition is met.
3. **Practical Use**:
    - Logical operators are used in `WHERE`, `HAVING`, and `ON` clauses for filtering data.

4.
UNKNOWN AND TRUE = UNKNOWN
UNKNOWN OR TRUE = TRUE

5.
UNKNOWN AND FALSE = FALSE
UNKNOWN OR FALSE = UNKNOWN

6.
NOT UNKNOWN = UNKNOWN
%%


%% 
In **XOR** (exclusive OR), the two conditions must be **different**—one must be **true** and the other must be **false**. If both are **true** or both are **false**, the result is **false**.

SQL doesnt have a direct **XOR** (exclusive OR) operator. However, you can achieve XOR logic using combinations of **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT**. It is not commonly required in typical SQL queries, so you are likely not going to need it often.

If you ever do need XOR-like behavior, you can implement it using this pattern:

-- XOR in SQL: (A AND NOT B) OR (NOT A AND B)
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE (condition1 AND NOT condition2)
   OR (NOT condition1 AND condition2);

This simulates the XOR logic by selecting rows where only one of the conditions is true (not both). But, as you noted, it is not something that comes up often in SQL queries

### Arithmetic Operators

```sql
SELECT id, name,
       (days * dayrate) AS monthSalary,
       ((days * dayrate) + 100) AS monthsalaryWithBonus
FROM employees;

SELECT (11 % 2);  %% 1 %%
SELECT (10 / 2);  %% 5.0000 %%
SELECT (10 div 2);  %% 5, div is the integer division and always return an int %%
SELECT round((10 % 2));  %% 5 %%
```
