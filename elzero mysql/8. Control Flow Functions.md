- **`CASE` is evaluated sequentially**: Once a condition is met, the corresponding `THEN` result is returned, and the remaining conditions are ignored.
- **`ELSE` is optional**: If no conditions match and `ELSE` is not provided, the result will be `NULL`.
- **`CASE` can be used in `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and other clauses**: It is versatile for applying logic directly in your SQL queries.
